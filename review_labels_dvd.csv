The transfers of the 5 movies found here are worth every penny! We grew up watching these on Philadelphia's channel 17 with show host Dr. Shock and the Creature Double Features back in the mid 70's. The pictures were always so dark and grainy, WELL NOT ANYMORE FOLKS! Universal has done an Amazing job on the picture clean-up and sound restoration! Bright and crystal clear along with wonderful sound! Also a very nice fold out DVD holder! The theatrical trailers were transferred in their original release condition which will allow you to compare how good of a job was done on the restoring of the movies to DVD! Don't wait to long in purchasing your set at a cheap price, they have already disappeared off of store shelves in our area!	1
Do not buy this DVD as it is a total waste of money,Joe Walsh canbe heard on a much better DVD with Eagles Farewell 1 Melbourne,Au. This DVD DOES NOT have DTS 5.1 Audio format as advertised	0
"They spend the first half of this movie saying how great the Ultimate Warrior was.  The journey is awesome!  Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they address this?  This ""docu"" is more slanted than ""Fahrenheitt 911"" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it. It just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking."	0
"I should say up front that I have never played chess, nor do I understand the game. But I remember being intrigued about the film when I saw the theatrical trailer. Was I intrigued because of the fact that the film was about a young boy with a special gift of a game? Was it the intense images of competition? Was it a curiosity about the game of chess itself and how it was played? Or was it about a deeper struggle within the boy? The answer is all of the above. ""Searching For Bobby Fischer"" is an excellent family film for all. I am living proof that even those who don't know jack about chess will love this movie. It is a movie not just about chess, but about acceptance, the bond of love and friendship, compassion for others, and not being afraid to be who you want to be. The balance of drama with edge-of-your-seat competition makes this a truly remarkable film.Max Pomeranc plays the young and sensitive Josh Waitzkin, a pint-sized seven-year old with a cute lisp, who becomes fascinated with the ""lower class"" men playing chess in a New York park. He watches the men, his eyes shifting with each move of the pieces. He convinces his mother to go to the park with him, where he plays a game of chess with an older gentleman. It is there that Josh's mother realizes her son has a knack for chess. Also noticing Josh is the fast-talking park chess player, Vinnie (a funny and great performance from Laurence Fishburne) who befriends the boy and eventually teaches him a thing or two about the game. After a match with Josh, Josh's father (played by Joe Mantegna) realizes his son's special gift and enlists the help of a stern but knowledgeable chess teacher named Bruce (played by Ben Kingsley) to make Josh an even better chess master. Bruce sees a young Bobby Fischer in Josh and cannot resist the temptation to take him under his wing and perhaps fill the void that Bobby Fischer left in the country after his mysterious disappearance. Through all the technical strategies of the game being learned, Josh and Bruce develop a good friendship and with Bruce's help, combined with his own special gift, Josh excels in chess tournaments and collects a shiny bundle of trophies. But there may be a test even harder than becoming a grand master of chess.We've all heard of parents trying to live their dreams through their children, especially when a parent sees a special gift in their child. But what happens when the thrill of competition and the persistent need to win cloud the parents' mind too much? And what happens when a beloved teacher wants you to be a carbon copy of someone or something that you're not? These are tests that run way deeper for Josh Waitzkin than any chess tournament. Josh learns quickly how addictive competition is and how obsessed people can become with a certain game. In his own way, the insightful Josh shows his father and teacher that he is not one of these people who lives and breathes chess like Bobby Fischer did. In the process, Josh pushes his father and teacher's feelings about him and the game of chess to the brink where they find they have to rethink their feelings. It's a matter of what is more important: chess competition, or love? Through it all, the three of them find that they can tolerate losing at chess but cannot tolerate losing something more dear; love and friendship for each other no matter what. There are some truly touching scenes in the film from the lecture Josh receives from his dad in the pouring rain, to the visit from his teacher at the Chicago tournament which comes toward the end of the show. But amongst the competition and drama, there are some nice comic scenes from Vinnie's trash talking against the others in the park, to the scene where the all the parents are literally locked up away from their kids during a tournament because they are so obnoxious, to the humorous appearance by William H. Macy when he offers to get Josh's dad a tuna sandwich. The climax comes in the huge chess championship at the end of the film where Josh takes Bruce and Vinnie's teachings along with his own style of playing and faces off against another chess prodigy named Jonathan. Jonathan is a boy I feel sorry for in the film. Playing since he was four years old, all Jonathan knows is chess and goes about life with a glazed expressionless look on his face. Perhaps this boy is proof of what living for a game can do to you, especially when you cannot just be a kid.The acting is terrific. Ben Kingsley, Max Pomeranc and Joe Mantegna give us a very touching and real performance in this film. It's too bad that Pomeranc did not act much since this film because he was a great little actor and very convincing. A nice touch to the movie is the real black and white film clips of a very young Bobby Fischer talking about and playing chess with Pomeranc narrating along. It gives us a bit of the history of the world's greatest chess player and also gives us the implication that people were searching for a new chess hero to fill the void when Bobby Fischer vanished; enter Josh Waitzkin.""Searching For Bobby Fischer"" is one of those stand-up-and-cheer films that is perfect fun for the whole family with some valuable lessons to be learned as well! This is a movie you'll want to watch time and time again."	1
This movie was only slightly better than your basic horror cliche; the nuclear testing/mutant premise seemed promising, but all the main characters were stupid/annoying.  Seemingly to make up for the lack of interesting characters, the script-writers/director threw in lots of unnecessary gore.  For the most part, though, the special effects were at least well-done; however, a few of the effects were somewhat misguided.  For instance, blood on bodies that have been sitting out for awhile in the hot desert is red; wouldn't it dry to brown very shortly in that kind of heat??  Acting was mediocre.  I've never seen the original, so I cannot say whether this is better or worse.  The movie is not for the faint-of-heart simply because of the gore, but it definitely wasn't very scary.  Two stars	0
King Vidor's rather contrived adaptation of Tolstoy's epic riddled with miscast actors, a boring script, and a hurried screenplay.  In short, another one of those 50-year old films that have outlived their audience to slowly sink into Hollywood's vaults of oblivion.The story follows the main characters of Tolstoy's novel such as Natasha (Audrey Hepburn), Prince Andrei (Mel Ferrer), and Pierre (Henry Fonda.)  The film is too short for the novel and the acting stinks: particularly that of Henry Fonda as Pierre.  Henry Fonda is as stiff as fossilized wood in this film; his pondering stare and preaching voice reminds me of a bad Charleton Heston film.  As far as the battle scenes so greatly praised by the main reviewer, they are as sparse as they are realistic.  All of the costumes and props in this film are horribly fake.In short, the only thing that remains impressive about this film is the fact that Hollywood bothered to put it on DVD.  Apart from that, the acting is as worthless as the contrived screenplay and shallow dialogue.  Don't buy this film	0
"So this was the breakout movie for Mira Sorvino, the one that earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1995. This movie, and Mira Sorvino's performance in it, was so bad that after it was over, I just had to find out who her competitors were for the 1995 Best Supporting Actress category. Let's see.....according to Wikipedia they were: Kathleen Quinlin (""Apollo 13"" - a fairly standard worried-wife-of-astronaut-in-danger role), Mare Winningham (""Georgia"" - did not see this one), Joan Allen (""Nixon"" - did not see, but how hard can it be to play the wooden Pat Nixon?), and Kate Winslet (""Sense and Sensibilities"" - did not see either, but Ang Lee was robbed by the Academy here also).It only proves just how few good roles there are for women in today's Hollywood that Mira Sorvino could win an Oscar for this sort of performance.And I was beginning to warm up to her, too - she was great in ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"", and terrific also in ""Beautiful Girls"".  So, what exactly is so bad about this movie?  Here's a brief list:1. Mira Sorvino plays the entire movie in a high-pitched falsetto that sounds like her voice is breaking. Another reviewer described this as similar to listening to fingernails on a blackboard. Maybe in 1995, because she was new, the Academy didn't realize that this wasn't her real voice and took pity on her....2. Stupid plot device of the Greek Chorus.3. Stupid happy ending with a twist.4. Lots of profanity and dialogue that includes explicit descriptions of sex acts done in pornography movies.....while this movie is not itself a porn flick, the explicit details of the porn industry included in the dialogue definitely makes it NOT a movie for families to watch.  5. Odd sight of a very old and wrinkly Woody Allen (with dyed hair and bald spot) making out with TWO women young enough to be his granddaughters.....all right, so I'm just jealous - Woody still looks gross....6. Cliched, poorly developed characters, a plotline that goes around in circles, and lots and lots of pointless, unfunny dialogue.In summary, this movie is bad, bad, bad......"	0
This Joe d'Amato film takes the Women in Prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze, bordering on pornography. The plot, or lack thereof, is typical: woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards  corruption. To make the film last 80 minutes, Joe d'Amato fills the story  with lesbianism, vile tortures, naked women in rat infested sewers, and  plenty of gratuitous sex. I gave this movie 1 star because there is no  option for a 0 star rating. Even hardcore fans of Euro sex queen Laura  Gemser will find this one a total bore	0
"i haven't seen this movie in years so when i saw it at block-busters i had to rent it. my favorite part is when tom essexplayed by the handsome dana ashbrook put a screwdriver threw thehead and the head said ""get that damn screwdriver out of my head"" i couldn't stop laughing it was so funny. i never really liked many horror-comedy movies but this one is really good.the best actor in this movie was dana ashbrook, he was not onlyfunny but he was very brave and sexy to boot.if not many people liked this movie at lease watch it for his performance because he was amazing. he makes me want to watch itover and over and over again"	1
More time could have been spent in Ney York City for this movie. Like with Friday The 13th Part Seven: The New Blood, all of the good gore scenes were cut out. But still, this is a terrible movie and I am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five	0
"Less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor, ""In Like Flint"" still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the Bond films.  The indomitable Derek Flint returns to save the world, this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world's women while replacing powerful males with surgically-altered substitutes (leading to, perhaps, the most prescient line of dialogue in any 1960s film--upon discovering that the man in the White House is not who he seems to be, a disbelieving Flint says, ""An actor as president?"").  That is, until a renegade ZOWIE general (Steve Inhat) decides it's his turn to take the reins of power.  The delightful Lee J. Cobb is back as Flint's curmudgeonly boss, Cramden, as are the secret agent's posse of female admirers, and TV's Batgirl, Yvonne Craig, even shows up as a Russian ballerina.  ""In Like Flint"" feels more grown up than the previous film, partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody.  Notions like the Red Scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind--and charging a premium for them--are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows, cross-dressing, and the bouncing sing-a-long ball.  Only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either Flint film worth comment, as it's a staple of the genre, meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort:  a no-frills DVD.

"""The Last American Virgin"" was literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot. It's not a surprise no one from this film went on to any sort of stardom. The writing was terrible, the acting was terrible, the direction was terrible, the pacing was terrible, the jokes were god-awful, etc. Even the girls weren't really that attractive (with the huge '80s hair and bad fashion)! I mean, what the hell was that fat, ugly, dorky girl with the glasses doing in this movie, and, even more perplexing, why was our ""hero"" trying to lay her?? And why was our ""hero"" best friends with that jerk who kept screwing him over with the girl he was in love with? They would be at each other's throats in one scene and then best friends in the next! I would say that the only redeeming quality of this movie was the soundtrack, but then they started repeating the same songs over and over again. I guess the producers ran out of money to fund the rights to extra songs. They played ""Whip It"" twice, ""Shake It Up"" at least three times, and, at last count, ""Just Once"" like five times, when ""Once"" was certainly enough. Songs that I didn't know at the beginning of the movie I  knew by heart word for word by the end. To top it all off, this movie had one of the worst, most disastrous endings I've ever seen. I can maybe understand if this was a heartfelt, coming-of-age drama, but when you're doing a mindless, teen-sex comedy, you don't end on a downer and depress the audience! After all the hell our ""hero"" goes through, he ends up driving home alone without the girl and still a virgin, and then, without any follow-up or warning, the credits start rolling! I was like, ""What the hell?""The only great thing about the movie is that I had a ball paying ""MST3K,"" only no one was around to appreciate my witty, sardonic remarks, so I'll have to reproduce them here for your pleasure: On Arguing with Your ""Best Friend"" Over the ""Love of Your Life"":""Hey, I stalked her first!"" On Sparking Up a Romance with Said Girl:""Remember our awkward conversation in my pizza mobile? Didn't that mean anything to you??""

On Major Operations, ""Not that Big a Deal"":Real line (referring to the girl's upcoming abortion): ""Hey, it happens all the time. It's not that big a deal.""My line: ""Yeah, it's a simple coat hanger procedure!""(and later)Real line: ""I know dozens of girls who've done it!""My line: ""I've helped all the gals in the neighborhood.

Where are they?""My line: ""I have to be home by midnight or my parents will kill me! So fu*k me in the a$$ and let's do some blow before they come home!"" On Choose Your Mate Carefully:(as our ""heroes"" scratch their balls after having sex with a promiscuous, older woman) ""Nothing's funnier than getting gonorrhea, eh folks?!""Skip this dreck and rent ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" instead.

Once again I truly benefitted from another Ellen Barrett workout DVD. Her cueing, instruction and professionalism show it. She knows how to turn what some consider a tedious plain exercise into a spot on fun, enjoyable and worth it workout!	1
I was very disappointed in the quality of this DVD.  I would not recommend anyone buying this DVD until the quality is back to that of a professional recording	0
I was just using this tape and ended it half-way through to write a review.  The cueing stinks and is frustrating.  I am just getting back into exercising after a few months off and have been using Firm tapes on and off for about 15 years.  This one seems effective but annoying because there is no cueing.  Stephanie changes moves constantly and just says the name of the move while she is doing and it is SO FRUSTRATING.  You want a work out where you actually work - not waste your time trying to read the instructor's mind and falling all over the bench! 	0
Timeless classic movie. 2 of the songs are frequently re-done by various artist	1
This is a fantastic movie! The acting is superb, and it keeps you guessing until the end. Nicole Kidman deserved her Oscar	1
This DVD was a total disappointment.  First of all, this video was a rip off of Baby Genius series, but without the production value.  Second, this video promises to introduce your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits.  To be fair, there are fruits and vegetables, but not so cleverly disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals (grilled turkeys etc.) and rotten milk (in other term cheese), chicken period (eggs), ice cream ( I think it's a child abuse to feed your 6 month old ice cream!) and other non-fruit and non-vegetable foods.  This video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk of parmasan cheese that's bigger than baby's head!  I believe it is morally right to properly advertise your product and not misrepresent what your product has to offer, especially when it comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition.  I would NOT recommend this video for vegetarians, vegans, or other parents looking to teach their children proper health and eating habits.	0
This is definitely the best Ab workout. Working in a desk job,I kept gaining weight around the Ab area. After just two days of this DVD, I had results. It was incredible. The fat around my abs just kept shrinking andshrinking. I would recomend this to anybody. No matter how fit you are,there are four levels of difficulty. Practically anybody cando the first level. I do all four. Already I am seeing results.I hope he puts out more videos for upper body strength as well.Cannot stress how fast the results are. You will probably see results within a week	1
"This could have been an excellent documentary, but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly. This is particularly true in the way it depicts Sparta as being some kind of Womyn's Power state which is absurd. Somewhat comically, the narrator enhances the story of Sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus. She tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi-sexuality. Hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a ""feminist wonderland,"" but that's exactly what is implied. I don't know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as: ""Fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother."" Yeah right! Unless of course, husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal.  Pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful. To many counter-culturalists, history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program. Unfortunately, that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work. As for Bettany Hughes, I agree that she is quite attractive, but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy. Hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing Sparta--I'll take Victor Davis Hanson any day over her. I recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians."	0

"Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Nineteenth century novella ""Notes from Underground"" and the plot of this twenty first century movie carry identical messages. The movie is an eloquent cinematic adaptation of the novel that gives Dostoevsky's central character a new breath of life from the modern day perspective.The movie attempts to survey the convoluted mind of a building inspector through a video-taped self confession. The psychological similarities between the character in Dostoevsky's novel and the building supervisor in the movie are uncanny. Both characters share a state of mind that is the epitome of a human condition where miserable anti hero attitude reigns through a heightened level consciousness and the rationality of everyday living through action is put to rest. The character in the movie who identifies himself as a ""sick man, a spiteful man"" lives his life in isolation by the drowning himself into the puddle of his own conflicting thoughts. He despises his friends and at the same time he seems eager to improve his relationship with them.  The character in the movie voluntarily creates unpleasant scenarios that trigger his eventual self demise. He often finds himself confined within the conflicting walls of his consciousness. He falls in love with a prostitute but at the same time he is utterly disgusted by her profession and tries to dominate her. By escalating the level of his thought process well above the habitual human awareness, the central character of the movie isolates himself from the crowd that Dostoevsky's narrator identifies as the ""Men of Action"". The building supervisor is paralyzed by the own consciousness just like the narrator in Dostoevsky's novel. Dostoevsky's novel and the movie helps us realize that the collective standard of self-consciousness that the society forces us to adapt through a methodical process of uniformity and conformity, has a negative side effect that is strong enough to paralyze our lives and inflict a profound sense of alienation in our minds.

"My objection was the implication that the ""stars"" played a part in the film.  I felt that the picture was completely deceptive. Ms Richards and Ms Hanna had less than 15 minutes (maybe a little more but not much and possible even less) and were clearly there to fool the viewer.  It was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary"	0
driller killer has, without question, the best director's commentary of any dvd i have ever seen. although driller killer is a far cry from his second film &quot;ms. 45&quot; it is a classic. reno can't seem to buy a thrill. despite the fact that he lives with two bombshells he can't get his painting finished to collect for the rent. his agent's reaction to his finished painting is absolutely priceless. what's worse is that his landlord has allowed a punk band to move in upstairs, adding insult to injury. the band, tony coca cola and the roosters, play &quot;the grand street stomp&quot; a guitar riff that has a great driving force. this film really documents the viallge punk circuit at the end of the 1970's. conventions are borrowed from polanski's &quot;repulsion&quot; and cassaveetes' &quot;shadows&quot;. the handheld mingling with the street people of the period shows how filthy NYC was at the time. Lots of fun. Driller Killer was meant to be listened to loud	1
"Whether William Golding deserved Nobel Prize or not is still a debatable point, but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book, and its name is `Lord of the Flies.' But let's not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while - because after all no one I am afraid can bring the multi-layered world of words onto the screen. Even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that. You can interpret the meaning of `Lord of the Flies' but who can really visualize it, or the imaginary conversations of Simon for that matter?The biggest problem of Harry Hook's new version is not the changes done to the film. The boys are American military school cadets, using dirty words frequently, but those parts didn't annoy me much. Real problem is something more essential to the film, which is storytelling. In short the 1990 film doesn't know what it wants to be. On the film's video cover you can read (and I quote) `this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul."" Well, not exactly.For as adventure story it lacks pace; the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing. As allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character. The conflict between Ralph and Jack should be clearer, and Piggy's role should be more than that of a whining fat boy. And don't forget Simon, who sees things, it is true, but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us.It is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful. It could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop, opposite of optimistic tales of Jules Verne's adventure stories. By watching this film you can follow the story of the book, but find no tension or thought-provoking words in it.Balthazar Getty's feature film debut. And Lewis M. Allen, one of the producers of the film, had also produced Peter Brook version in 1963"	0

"In America is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy. It is also about hope.The characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way. They are all trying to find a new life literally in Amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs.The only real downside I can note on this movie is that I would have liked a little more back ground on Frankie and Mateo but I think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks.Besides, a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life. I especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons. If you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see. If for nothing else than the performances of ""Mateo"" and young ""Kristie."" Just amazing."	1
The main character came across as gay to me too. This movie is in no way realistic. The other reviewer is right about everything. It's a really cheap movie made by amateurs using plastic toy guns, the actors jerk the guns to make them look like they have a kick. The &quot;martial arts&quot; in the movie are weak and sloppy, there's no way that crap would actually work in real life. I don't even know why I bothered to watch the whole thing, I guess I just found the stupidity amusing. The cover makes it look like it would be a cool movie, unfortunately that's the only thing they put much effort into. I rented it from Block Buster too, they need to burn it. This movie looks like some kind of a high school project or something, like they had to make a movie to pass drama class	0
The Wolf Man Legacy set a no brainer.Like all the classic Universal Legacy sets the special features are worth the price alone. Jack Pierce's Make up and Wolfman Creation are still the best!

You still need Abbott and Costello meets Frankenstein to truely complete the series	1
"The overwhelming impression I get from this film is: wow, these guys are alive! They are not just making their way through a boring life, they're out there doing interesting things, doing cool stuff, having adventures & generally living their lives to the fullest. The ""they"" that I refer to includes just about everybody in the movie, from Paul Pena to the guys travelling with him to Richard Feynman to the Tuvans that Paul meets and befriends.The documentary gets hazy in spots (I'm still not sure of some of the Tuvan inter-relationships) but does a good job of establishing empathy with Pena, a blind man relying on others in a place far from home. The DVD extras are o.k., the interview with the filmmakers gave some backstory to the movie. I did not watch the film with the filmmakers commentary turned on; a commentary seems kind of contrary to the purpose of a documentary but I suppose you could get more factual info & technical details on the commentary"	1
"  THE TRANSFORMERS gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980's.  It pains me to say this for I am a fan of the series.  It was a travesty to see Optimus Prime (the greatest of the Transformers) fall in battle and pass on the Matrix of Leadership to a successor (Rodimus Prime) who proved incapable of leadership.  Galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of Megatron--he lacked the malevolent cunning of Megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic.  Why would a Decepticon warrior follow him into battle?  As for the new generations of Autobots and Decepticons introduced in the movie, they were forgettable.  It amuses me that ""fans"" are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago.  THE TRANSFORMERS failed at the box office and I am glad it did.  As a fan, I was insulted.  Perhaps these other ""fans"" have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage.  "	0

great book, too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds.  i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie, almost didn't finish reading it.  they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film.  on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira's voice was right on, and while the movie character of Brom was fully wasted, jeremy irons did a fine job.  i look forward to starting the next book, but will skip the next movie. 	0
This is the dumbest, most predictable, horrible waste of time i've ever ever seen.  This movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply wasn't.  It took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that's supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe, drink, and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us.  After watching this movie I felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash.  my only hope is that our european friends didn't seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident	0
"If you want to see Lena Heady's breasts exposed, this is the film to watch.  But besides the numerous unnecessary topless scenes (which aren't too bad) this film is very intriguing...the human spirit tries to break through walls of addiction, frustration and isolation... now isn't that what a ""suspense"" drama should be about"	1
"Really not worth the effort to find it, even if George MacDonald Fraser was involved with the screenplay. The producers chose the ""least best"" of the Flashman novels to adapt, they cast the wrong actor to play the role, and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy, not-very-funny, slapstick comedy. Don't bother searching for it. True Flashman fans will be disappointed"	0
i saw this for a good price.  i checked for reviews.  there were all theese great reviews. whatever!  the movie has pretty much no action.  the sound video actin is good, but its lonnggand sloowww.  there was some good nudity.  that is the only thing keepin me from totally considering this as a loss. ok movie jus dont expect action jus anticipate the nudity cause that is the only thing interesting besides the falcon in this movie. i love falcons, so there you go.  i think of it as good enough to keep thats it. maybe ill pop it in to watch a long slow movie with a girlfriend. take this as the downside reviewso all theese other reviews don fool you into thinking this movie is all tha	0
I'll start out by saying that I prefer the Jason movies.  I think the whole body count is a fun way to watch a horror movie.  The Freddy movies are good horror movies, but they're not really slashers like I thought they would be. - A Nightmare on Elm Street - A great, classic horror movie by Wes Craven.  He creates good high school characters, although trying to prove that they're only 15 years old is a little far-fetched.  Freddy is more horrific and scary, he doesn't say much.- A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge - They were asking for it when they completely changed the style and rules of Freddy in this sequel.  Many will disagree, but I don't think it's a bad movie, it's just very dark and horrific.- A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors - Definately a step up from Part 2.  It goes back to the roots of the original film and brings back Nancy, who is now studying dreams and sleep in a mental hospital.  The style brings us back to the original movie with the same rules and objectives.- A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master - Decent entry in the series carrying over characters from #3 and introducing all new characters.  The story doesn't flow as easily this time around and it's a step down from Part 3, but still good.- A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child -Stephen Hopkins' visual style makes this the best sequel in the series.  Freddy is hilarious and the special effects are great.  The story is more interesting than Part 4 and the characters have matured since that movie which is good.- Freddy's Dead - The Final Nightmare - Cheesy storyline trying to tell us that in 10 years there will be no kids left in an American town?  Rachel Talalay thinks the 3-D effects in the film are lame, but not that story element?  If it weren't for the interesting backstory on Freddy, this wouldn't be a good movie.- Wes Craven's New Nightare - Wes Craven did succeed in making an interesting and well made horror movie here, but it is a little strange to include it in the rest of the series.  Better watched on its own and not consecutively with the other movies.- Nightmare Encyclopedia - Alot of interviews that aren't edited very interestingly make for a decent special features disk.  It's good to see that these interview aren't self serving at all and they're completely retrospective, it would've been nice to hear more from Heather Langenkamp, or possibly Johnny Depp?This is a great set for extreme fans and a good set for casual fans.  I'm a huge fan of the Alien series and a pretty big fan of the Predator series, but not as much as Alien.  I would say that I'm now a huge fan of Jason and a good sized fan of Freddy in comparison to Alien/Predator.  I do recommend these movies, but this enormous box with annoying cardboard cases is outdated for today	1
Arturo Bandini (Colin Farrell) arrives from Colorado to Los Angeles. He is an aspiring writer who is getting down to his last nickel. He prays for inspiration to find another interesting story to write.  He meets a mexican waitress, Camilla (Salma Hayek) in a cafe and they just don't like each other, or do they?  Finally Auturo hits the mother lode. A letter he wrote has been changed into a short story for publishing along with a handsome paycheck.  It is just enough for him to buy a new suit outfit, a few suppers and pay the rent for a while.  Arturo is a very well mannered man, but keeps meeting these strange characters that get him all wrong.  Plays like film noir. The cinematography of 1934 Los Angeles is wonderful.  Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek in the moonlit ocean was breathtaking.  Colin Farrell perfected his American accent.  Very tastefully down skinny-dipping scenes and beautiful to watch.  AH! Give Colin a break. The water was cold.DVD includes Audio commentary, making of..., theatrical trailer	1
I am not a spring chicken, so I get introduced to anime through my daughter. Some of it is fluffy love stories or improbable characters or situations that appear from nowhere to solve the day. Full Metal is none of these. The characters are believable even when they are a talking metal suit of armor. Ed and Al are young boys. Their mother dies. They desparately want her back. They do something forbidden. They pay. And they learn what the costs are. The world is a confusing place. They navigate, sometimes on their own and sometimes with people who they meet along the way. Not everyone is who they seem at the start. Finally they confront the costs of their and other peoples violations of the rules. Through the story there is humor and growth. The story is told from their point of view. They do not give in to the tragedies that surround them and keep fighting for the truth and for each other. I highly recommend this series for young teens and old fogies (that's me). Much better than most things available for teens these days. I rank this up with Dante and Faust as literature about pacts made by people not understanding the full consequences of their actions fighting to restore the balance of their lives.	1
"If the girls in this film were considered ""hot"" back in 1979 then I'm glad I was still in preschool.Some unattractive women, not college age girls, but actual 30-year-old women who cannot get into the popular Pi sorority start their own sorority called H.O.T.S. which stands for Help Out The Seals and sadly their pet seal was the best part of the movie.The goal of the H.O.T.S. girls is to steal all the guys away from Pi house, so they throw ""wild"" parties, jump topless out of a airplane (too bad the camera was on the ground), fly a hot air balloon over the Pi house to launch pies on the Pi girls as they sunbathe topless, etc.  The script seems to have been written by a 12-year-old, which isn't a bad thing.  I liked the fast-paced wackiness of it all and the frequent topless scenes were nice.  Unfortunately I didn't find any of the girls even remotely attractive.If this film was remade today with the same amount of nudity and with Nikki Ziering, Brittany Daniel, Shannon Elizabeth and Jenna Jameson as the four main H.O.T.S. girls and maybe Catherine Bell as the house mom it would gross over $800 million in DVD sales.I also agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained about the lack of rear shots.  How rude"	0
I bought the DVD for my collection after watching the film on TCM.  The musical perfomances are terrific.  Upon receiving the DVD, I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD production.  The DVD states Digital sound, but the sound quality is very poor and not at all as enjoyable as the broadcast on TCM. 	0
Oh! How I will never forget seeing the re-release of this film.It was in 1974 and I could not keep my eye's from it.It is now2006 and I still can't.What this movie is to me is a place inmy heart and being a avid collector of films from the silentsto the classics and obscure I find that very meaningful.If youhave not seen 7th you are missing out. It truly is a funtasticfilm.I put this above Jason and the argonauts for my reasonalone(I KNOW I STAND ALONE IN THIS FOR JASON HAS MORE monsters and the great Ray Harryhausen has said JASONis his fav.along with many of his fans).What 7th has aboveJason for me is MUSIC! A soundtrack to a film has alwaysbeen a extra push to a film and the 7th voyage has thatextra push on Jason.Bernard Herrman's score is so dreamlikeyou can close your eyes and leave 7th on and the music is trancelike especially the snake woman dance.Please anyonewho reads this have 7th voyage in your collection(Jason& the argonauts too for that matter).You wont be dissapointedI will always be grateful to have seen this on the big screenand never forget it,I hope when you watch Ray Harryhausen'schildren and Bernard Herrman's music come to life you toowill not forget it.Some say Gone with the wind,Wizard of OzCasablanca,Citizen Kane,Jaws, Star Wars(77), Superman(78)E.T. Titanic,2001 a space & Pulp Fiction.Not me! If I wason a island and could only have one film from my library(ouch!I have alot of films and alot I love)but I wouldhave to pick The Seventh Voyage.That would be the one for me on the island.And please let it be the isle ofcolossus.	1
I was trying to watch it, but can not open de DVD because it is the wrong country code????	0
Its amazing how strongly images and music can impact the senses without any spoken word.    This is a great film to throw on, relax, and absorb.  	1
ridiculous plot, one dimensional cardboard-like acting (especially leon lai's rigid dead-like-fish-out-of-water performance), incoherent dialogs, horrible editing and directing, every thing is so bad if compares it to the first one. the second one has already turned bad but not as bad as this 3rd increment. the screen writers were obsessed with abnormal twists of the plots and tried to twist every section of the scenario to the extreme but unfortunately almost messed up the logic flow of a storyline. nothing deep but shallow all the way. just like a magician overplayed his black magic and suddenly found himself exposed completed without white gloves, long sleeves, and black cloak, even the white pigeons turned out to be dead. nothing could be hidden up in his sleeves or the tall hat. nothing at all. curtain call, drop it sooner than later.	0
This movie was cheeseball beginning to end...I thought the concept was corny even before I watched it but decided to give it a try anyway. Big mistake. A robot who can love? Lame! And with all this high tech stuff the docs can't bring the couple's real son out of a coma (or whatever was wrong with him) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can 'love' but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone..Brialliant plan (especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world)..Then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin. The family decides they don't want the robot and the mom 'loves' him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of...It was then I knew I was smelling a stinker but NOOOOO someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth...I have since nicknamed it Artificial Idiocy...The worst part was the end, Ugh, I don't even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what I mean. The whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism. For those of you who have not seen it, I suggest renting it before you buy it. Maybe this movie is great for some people, it just wasn't my thing. 	0
5 CLASSIC FILMS BY ONE OF THE BEST AFRICAN AMERICAN DIRECTORS OF ALL TIME FOR $20.00! IF YOU THINK THIS ISN'T A GREAT DEAL THAN OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A PROBLEM! MO BETTA BLUES IS ONE OF THE MOST WELL PUT TOGETHER PIECES AND IF YOU ENJOY THE FILMS I SUGGEST LISTENING TO THE ACTUAL SOUNDTRACKS	1
Yes. Wild things is what I recommend for our jaded eyes. Aren't we sick of all the crowd pleasing PG-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot? Wild Things is sex sex sex but with witty capital H humor and a twisted story.Recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film. Candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast (from Oscar nominee Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon etc) can turn candy into cuisine	0
The movie is a piece of art. One of my all time favorites. The Extended edition DVD is very badly compiled. The Bonus features are sub par with bad video quality. The alternate ending and beginning look like they are from a totally different film, and do not have the BI look and feel. Other special features are small and without much substance. The extended edition of the film itself is not spectacularly extended. It is not a director's cut (the DVD states this upfront in the opening credits) so it not fun to watch. Don't get this if you are looking for a LOTR style extended edition	0
"Mira Nair produced a film which is very entertaining, magical, and realistic in how it portrays the stresses and experiences associated with planning a modern wedding in India. The bride is a college educated beauty who has some liberated ideas and behaviors  ... but she is also the the only daughter of her parents, a child of her culture. She agrees to an arranged marriage to the handsome son of a friend of the family... after a failed love affair (first secret in the film) from which she is not yet fully recovered. Aditi feels ready for marriage, so she tells her unmarried female cousin Ria who has some doubts about the matter. The unique traditions of the past are combined with modern touches - the past and present intertwine in unexpected ways to produce a beautiful and creative collage of whacky entertainment. The street scenes filmed in New Delhi symbolically represent the chaotic atmosphere, tensions and pressures of the preparations for a wedding. The plans are to create a joyous celebration ... to be remembered by both families ...and cherished for a lifetime. Family arrived from America, Dubai, and Australia ... to celebrate the blessed union of two young people in marriage.Lalit Verma, father of the bride takes his role seriously, his personality, character, and approach provide many of the comic and serious touches in the film. He displays extraordinairy sensitivity to a family tragedy that is unexpectedly revealed (the second secret) and takes courageous action to deal with the problem directly. He proves to be a caring, loving father whose integrity ensures the wedding preparations continue as planned, allowing nothing to mar the perfection of the moment. He even asks for a temporary loan from business associates to meet mmediate ""cash flow"" problems as the costs keep mounting upwards. The casting for all the roles are superb. The music was incorporated into the story of the film, enhancing and emphasizing the emotions in many scenes. There was spontaneous singing during the ""mehndi"" ceremony when the women paint henna designs on the hands of the bride. There was a haunting solo sung about the bride leaving the loving palace of her father ... to become a stranger to his house forever after marriage. Several enjoyable modern Indian techno sounds exploded throughout the film making the scenes more lively and enjoyable. Along with the wedding, there are several stories interwoven within the fabric of the film ... The first and most important one is how the wedding plans for Aditi and Hermant could have unravelled after Aditit confessed her secret affair to him. While the two large tents are built in the backyard, garlands of marigolds {""the flower of love"") are woven, and the cost of water-proofing the tents is being negotiated - P.K. Dubey, the cell-phone carrying, dot.com business entrepeneur wedding event manager, and *bachelor* falls in love with Alice, the young maid and housekeeper for the Verma family. Meanwhile, Varun, Aditi's brother practices a dance he will perform at the 'sangeet' (engagement party?) with Ayesha, a very attractive cousin from Dubai. However, just before the party he clashes with his parents over his future educational plans. They decided he will be sent to a boarding school. Ayesha has been flirting with Rahul, a handsome young relative of the Verma's from Australia. They have even exchanged kisses in the dark. He had witnessed her dance sessions with Varun who now refuses to do the performance. When Rahul will not take Varun's place, one of the older ladies overhears and quotes poetry to him about his failure to rescue a lady in distress. She tells him straight up to get off his @ss ... Some of the most sensitive scenes include Ria, when she clues in on certain behaviors between Uncle Tej and Aleja, a young girl of about 6 or 7. Ria exposes Uncle Tej and at the same time reveals her own shame at having suffered a similar fate as a child. Lalit wrestles with how to handle this delicate situation. He couragously banishes Uncle Tej and his wife from his house. The wedding ceremony is a blessed and dignified event. It turns out to be perfect, a celebration of pure joy ... exactly as planned.Erika Borsos [pepper flower"	1
Love this movie!  Can't decide which version I like better - this one or the one with Grace Kelly and Bing Crosby!  Both are great	1
"Warning: Spoilers Abound.Okay folks, I was flipping channels and came across a movie called The Hole, starring Thora Birch, Keira Knightley and Desmond Harrington. Now, aside from this terrible blunder I'm going to tell you about in just a few more sentences, the film was fairly entertaining. I dig Thora Birch, and her character was really well-played. What really shocked me though, was my quick research after the film was over. I mean, I checked IMdB, Rotten Tomatoes and Wikipedia. Although all reputable sources, none mentioned this ridiculous mistake.Have you ever been so utterly sure of something so blantantly, painstakingly obvious that it would literally take an entirely different, alien planet to be able to even minutely comprehend the vast insipidness of its vacuous residents? That's how I felt after watching this movie and realizing that apparently I'm the only goddamn human being on this prosaic, infantile planet who immediately saw the dimwitted aberration for what it was!And what exactly was this stupendous error, you ask? Well... It's very simple. I mean, it couldn't get more common sensically moronic than this. The basic plot of the film is four teenagers trapped in an old war bunker. The movie begins with Thora Birch's rendition of what happened: that her friend set this whole thing up, locked them in the 'hole' and didn't come back when he was supposed to. She escapes and the three others die. The story changes from what she originally told her psychiatrist to what actually happened. Turns out the only way out was actually locked from the inside and Thora had the key the whole time. The other teenagers die for various reasons, irrelevant to the blunder at hand, and she ends up telling the tale to her psychiatrist from inside the bunker. In the end, she kills the guy who set it up and plants the key on him. The police come and find Thora and her psychiatrist in the 'hole' and after rebuking the psychiatrist, mention that the case is now closed. At that moment, a flashback shows Thora murdering her friend that set everything up and planting the key on him. Right after that moment, I said to myself: ""What the heck? The door locks from the inside?! It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that either a) the door was never locked, or b) someone had to unlock it from the inside!"" Alright, those weren't my exact words, but good god, it's so obvious!And that, my friends, has got to be possibly the worst film blunder ever"	0
"Othello is a difficult production for me to watch at any time. Seeing the horrors of jealousy run amuck to the destruction of innocence is painful at the best of times. In the instance of this production it is even more painful because it is so well done.The story of Othello is that of a Venetian general who marries a local daughter of a nobleman. The general happens to be black. In an effort to sabotage the general, Iago undermines the faith of the husband for his wife leading ultimately to the tragedy of her death. While Shakespeare gives motivations for his characters, interpretations and emphases tend to vary. Kenneth Brannagh's production of Othello emphasies Iago as a troublemake who likes to cause trouble simple for the sake of doing so. This production, with Ian McKellan in the role of Iago, puts more emphasis on his desire for revenge in reaction to a perceived slight. Both are accurate portrayals but the former seems to show more delight in ""being bad"" wheras the latter seems more inclined to ""get even"". Both are excellent and accurate but the emphasis in this film makes the heaviness of the theme that much more difficult to endure.The role of Desdemona is portrayed in this version by Imogen Stubb and she is a delight to watch. She bring an alluring innocence to the role that makes her demise all that much more tragic. So too is the title role played admirably. The problem with Othello is that he is at heart and honorable man but lets his passions rule him and cause him to lash out with devatiging consequence.This is a fine performance all around with a difficult play. If you can keep your anger at the antics of the characters in check, it is well worth the time"	1
I was expecting more because of the history on these tapes/DVD's. This one was disappointing as you don't feel like you did a workout. I like the older ones better with Tammy	0
This is without a doubt, one of Harrison Fords greatest moments. An incredible film with some of the best visual effects I've ever seen. Very dramatic with a lot of suspense. A very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view. A film you will want to see again and again. Action, mystery, drama, thriller. There are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such, but they don't in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama. I highly recommend it	1
Don't expect a comedy in the vein of TRINITY or THEY CALL ME TRINITY. If you do, you are in for a fall. Both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining. This one has no such pretensions. It is merely boring.The story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town's folk out of their claims. They do this through intimidation and violence. When a couple of friends get hold of a claim, they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys. To do this, they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction. They yell, they fight, they wrestle, they shoot and then they do it some more. Its not very exciting cinema.This production is made worse by the DVD. I suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair. The DVD, however, is of such low quality that who could really tell? The edges are clipped off, the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it. IT was not worth the effort.Spaghetti westerns can be fun. This one, however, needs the Pepto Bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn.	0
I loved this movie. It was very touching and projected a wonderful image. It was a rare find	1
I started watching it and couldn't stop. I read the book a long time ago and I still think that's better but the movie is really good too. Highly recommended	1
Personally, I found 8 1/2 to be one of the most boring films I've ever seen.  It was a pretentious, self-indulgent trip down the director's memory lane.  I understood the plot, and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end, but overall was bored silly by stilted, pointless dialogue.Having said that, the cinematography was stunning and the music almost made the film worth watching.  Perhaps 8 1/2 would have been better off as a series of photographs with musical accompaniment :P	0
"You know the feeling...that feeling of ""Oh my gosh, how did I ever spend money on this movie and when is it ever going to end?""  Well, that's what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film.   Unfortunately, because of its all-star cast, although this wouldn't be the first time in movie history where an all-star cast is wasted.  Aside from an interesting peek into the world of Yale's secret Skull and Bones society, a delightful cameo by Joe Pesci and a few too cute-by-half zingers, this movie has little or nothing to offer.  It doesn't keep one's attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on, you realize that you don't even care about the characters.  Matt Damon's skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry, especially with the beautiful Angelina Jolie, and he is laughably miscast as a father.  In fairness however, with the script he's been given, it's hard to see how Damon could have done much better.  The pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends.  A huge disappoinment especially since director DeNiro is such a talented actor.  Skip it"	0
Jean Renoir's masterpiece, 'the grand illusion', is truly a film about humanity - it is a universal theme, something we can all understand and relate to. The triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times, is kind of an ironic theme considering Hitler's imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history. Nevertheless, Jean Renoir's poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films. It is not hard to like this movie the acting and direction are superb - Jean Gabin is one of the all time great actors..Jean Renoir's innovative approach would influence countless directors to come, including Orson Welles..Criterion did a marvelous job on this dvd - also worth getting is 'the rules of the game' jean renoir's greatest satire	1
Agree that it was beautifully filmed, but.... there must have been a great deal lost in the translation	0
The documentary showed some highlights of some excellent flying by various pilots.  However it did not show the abilities of different jets and pilots from different NATO countries.  The actual excercise is much longer and the documentary could have covered moreThe presentation both the picture and sound are top notch.  We found out that not every DVD system can read the IMAX presentation	1
"This re-telling of the so-called ""zoot suit riots"" that rocked the Los Angeles homefront during World War II gets the facts right, but tells them rather poorly.  Part of it is the super-stagey presentation, which basically is a filming of the play this was based on (right down to the shaking props and backdrops) and which takes little advantage of the possibilities of the film medium. Plus, Edward James Olmos is absolutely insufferable as the uber-symbolic Voice of The Barrio, although Daniel Valdez and Tyne Daly (!) are okay in their respective roles as a young man railroaded by the white establishment for a crime he did not commit, and as the commie agitator who comes to his defense.  Anyone interested in the time period and in Chicano politics may benefit from watching this -- I rented it while doing some reseach on the ""pachucho"" R&B music scene -- but in dramatic and filmic terms, this is not a first-rate production.  It's hammy and ham-fisted.  Latter-day star spotting:  El Teatro Campesion veteran Robert Beltran (of future ""Star Trek Voyager"" notoriety) has a bit role as a modern-day audience member.."	1
One of the movies I like to watch over and over.  Jessica Tandy played a great character in this movie.  My order came real quick	1
I rented this movie for about six dollars and I have to say even that was a waste of money. I thought this movie was incredibly over acted, boring and hard on the eyes. The thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did. They were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial. For the superficial people out there I wouldn't watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you won't get it. When I found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible. I have no idea why this movie has any stars at all it was horrible and that would be considered a compliment	0
"This film is a perfect example of how straight action and big-name stars cannot replace the necessity of well written drama. I will not give away the plot -- although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it. Basically Clooney's character Mr. Ocean, a career burgler, is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a Las Vegas casino. So he recruits 11 men, each with a talent to add to the operation. This is where the trouble begins. The viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters. There is almost no introduction to many of them, and barely even a mention of their names. Literally half an hour into the film ""the eleven"" are assembled and they're already robbing the casino. How's that for plot development? And that's basically it ladies and gentlemen: go to Vegas, rob casino, go home, movie over. Some of the ""good guys"" are even outright repellant. Our would-be heros' enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy Hollywood tycoon. Am I supposed to like this fat weasel? The only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least Mr. Ocean, is that the guy he's robbing, the casion owner, is a really bad guy. Supposedly he has people killed 'n stuff. (This actor played a bad guy in Godfather Part 3). But we never see any real evil deeds. In fact, he just seems like a handsome, polite, very prosperous businessman. He manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film. Mr. Ocean on the other hand, and his cohorts, are career criminals. But the guy they're robbing is an even greater criminal, you see. So that makes it OK. And really, if you were being robbed, wouldn't you want to be robbed by George Clooney and Brad Pitt? They're such nice guys. That makes getting robbed fun. Just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy. How thrilling.This entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with Julia Roberts. There are a few minor things going on in the backgroung, like a boxing match, which are essentially irrelevent. Throughout there seems to be vital information missing (like say, a plot). Soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to Clooney and Roberts. This film is also horribly cut. Several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced, and then completely forgotten about. Take the scene where Pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino's owner makes an appearence. The folder he has just been handed, explains Pitt, contains secret security codes. You would think that would be something important right? You would think they will need to get those codes. Well, wrong. In fact you won't hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie. They introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development. And that happens all the time in this movie. In fact Mr. Ocean's team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties. (And boy, they started repelling down that shaft quick, didn't they? You didn't even know they were robbing the place yet. Wow, these guys are good. Or maybe Steven Soderbergh is as over-rated as his film.) They make it look easier than breaking into the safe at 7-eleven. This, after Mr. Ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have. One would hope this film would at least end strong. But Soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed. We are left wondering whether the ""eleven"" actually got away with their caper...or worse. What a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being light-hearted. The writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the DVD! (As did the actors in their commentary.)Probably the best moment on this DVD is hearing the screenwriter tell Soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending. I am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars, since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad, but this film comes very close to 1 star. This is your standard artistically worthless Hollywood product. It is big on budget, big on bling, and low on story. I suppose if you just feel like wasting some time, this is as good a way to do it as any. Personally I would rather have a story with more substance"	0
I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision. If you're thinking of buying it - rent it first. It was dull and obnoxious, not to mention weird. The only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate (which is why I gave it 1 star instead of 0). However, if you're still interested, definitely rent it, you might enjoy it.	0
$23 for the Chinese version and the English subtitles are mad.   The English subtitles available on American cable television enhance the drama so tape off of cable.  I don't regret this purchase because I think drama sets SHOULD be $25 tops and the camera is so CLEAR on this dvd compared to what is seen on American cable that you can really see how old the teenagers are.  It made for a more enjoyable viewing experience for ME when I didn't really care for it when it was mistier and flawless on cable. So what if there are a lot of matching fat scarves and sweaters in this series?  I don't get the appeal of this show at all.  I thought it was really slow.  My favorite part was a barfing drunk girl in the background of one scene but otherwise I felt my hair turning white watching the characters walk and walk, breath in, breathe out, and ponder ponder.  I think the phenomenon of the show's popularity is a tidge more interesting than the show but it is still boring boring boring.  Just thinking about this show, strips another layer of elasticity from my heart. It's so boring. p.s. This drama got a 20% rating domestically but Sam Soon and Jang Geum scored 50%.  Hahaha	0
"Until Sam Raimi made Spider-Man, I think we all regarded Tim Burton's Batman as the best superhero movie (even though I actually don't consider Batman to be a ""superhero"" because he has no superpowers). Burton directed this movie, and did a great job - this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s, except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then. Michael Keaton is Batman/Bruce Wayne. Needless to say, Batman is Wayne's alter ego. Keaton is magnificent at playing the character's alter ego. Keaton also does a good job playing the character when he's not in costume. Keaton's Bruce Wayne isn't as gloomy as Christian Bale's was in Batman Begins, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But I would say Bruce Wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the Schumacher movies. But overall, Bale's Bruce Wayne is superior to Keaton's because Bale has a much more developed character to play. HOWEVER, Keaton plays a better costumed Batman than Bale.The problem with this movie is that the Joker (Jack Nicholson) steals the show - the whole movie revolves around him, so this isn't Batman's movie. This movie should have been called ""The Joker."" So if you ever wondered why Nicholson got a higher billing than Keaton, now you know. The thing is, the writers never bothered to give Bruce Wayne a personality, and they barely scratch the surface of the character's background - we know practically nothing about Wayne. You'd think the guy that's Batman wouldn't be so uninteresting, but we're bored to tears everytime Wayne's onscreen (and out of costume). But when Keaton is onscreen in the Batman costume, Batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes. He plays an even more menacing Batman than Bale - so I say that Keaton does a better Batman than Bale, but that Bale does a better Bruce Wayne than Keaton. But Keaton didn't have anything to work with, so it's not his fault his Bruce Wayne is so weak. But one of the strengths of Keaton's performance is that if you ever met Wayne, he'd seem like the last guy in the World that could be Batman. That's something Kilmer and Clooney failed to accomplish, but thankfully Bale was able to do it.Michael Gough is a delight as the old butler Alfred. It's hard to believe Gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years. I assumed Michael Caine's Alfred wouldn't compare to Gough's, but I was wrong - they're both great. Pat Hingle was really good (as Commissioner Gordon) in this movie. Hingle and Gough were in all four movies of the original series, and I enjoyed them both in Batman Returns. But in Batman Forever I didn't like them nearly as much, and in Batman & Robin I found their characters annoying as hell.Vicki Vale's (Kim Basinger) investigation into Bruce Wayne's background is completely uninteresting. But I already knew what she would find out, so maybe that's why I didn't like those scenes. I also found the Vicki character annoying, screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen. There's lots of little things I love in this movie. The sight of Batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him, (and the terrified expression of the gunmen) with Elfman's dramatic music blaring. The look on Napier's face when he sees the emptied safe. When the guy got fried by the Joker's joy-buzzer (one of the worst deaths I've ever seen in a movie). When the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise, and the Joker's speech right before a mob boss dies. The first Action News report of the movie. The way ""URGENT"" is written in messy crayon on the parcel. When Batman jumps through the skylight (accompanied by Elfman's music). The design of the Batmobile - minor changes make the car even cooler in Batman Returns. When the Batmobile speeds toward the Batcave (again, Elfman's music is awesome). The grin on the young Jack Napier. The Batmobile attacking the chemical factory. The Joker's facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd. When the bat signal is lit - but it's not as awesome as the first time it's lit in Batman Returns, or when it's lit at the end of Mask of the Phantasm.And now a few complaints. This movie featured too many songs by Prince. After a while, they get unbearably annoying. There were lots of other great `80s pop songs that could have (and should have) been used in this movie. Another thing is the Joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up. So I found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring. By the way, you can tell that Nicholson's make-up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking. Burton's Batwing is cooler than Schumacher's Batwing (but not as cool as the one in Mask of the Phantasm). Anyway, the targeting system of Burton's Batwing seems a little screwed up - Batman has a big red target locked on the Joker, but the plane's missiles and machine guns miss their target. And the Joker didn't even try to get out of the way! Looks like Batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems.I always overlooked this movie's flaws (until I saw Batman Begins) for two reasons. First of all, I found Keaton's Batman to be so cool and the Joker to be so entertaining that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie. Second of all, the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is. Pretty much everytime the Joker or the Batman aren't onscreen, the movie is boring. But I must say that Batman was even cooler in Batman Returns than he was in this movie - and nastier."	1
What a HUGE disappointment this release is.  I was suspecting that it wouldn't be all that great when I saw that the studio that originally produced this show, 20th Century Fox, was the same video company releasing it.  Well, the first season looks horrible.  The source material is all 16mm dupe prints, some parts of which are out of focus, scratched and dirty.  In all cases the image is soft and, well, like 16mm.  Compared to what Fox is releasing of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, produced the same year (1964) and at the same studio as BOONE, this release is nothing short of a disgrace.  We should be given pristine 35mm source material, and we're not.  I suspect Fox wouldn't release the original camera negs from it's vaults without a substantial fee.  Anyway, season one of DANIEL BOONE isn't worth buying.  I haven't seen season two, when the show started filming in color, but I'm now afraid to look	0
Ashley Judd's (Normal Life, The Locusts) husband, played by Jim Caviezel (The Passion Of The Christ, Frequency) gets arrested and put on the guilty bench for a slaughter in El Salvador a bunch of years ago. So, Judd hires the always superb Morgan Freeman (Unleashed, Million Dollar Baby) to help her out on the case and to find out the truth while she tries to get her husband out of imprisonment. Judd then has threats on her life after. The opening sequence pulls you in, the thrills are a mixed bag (car crash scene for example was good) and the outcome, well, I really saw coming anyway. Ashley Judd's thrid thriller but its her second one with a murderous manipulative husband(Double Jeopardy). Twisted and Kiss The Girls had a killer running after her or playing games with her noggin. Also starring Bruce Davison (X-Men, Dahmer), Amanda Peet (The Whole Nine Yards, The Whole Ten Yards) and Tom Bower (Die Hard 2	0
"obviously, the music featured here is of high-quality.  hardly sign of the times transcendent, but nonetheless very exciting (as was typical of prince's 2002 tour).  unfortunately the director does his/her upmost to ruin everything for you with sub-bootleg grainy picture quality and warped sound, hamfisted camera angle switches, bizarre washed-out colors, some horribly cheesy effects and cuts.  for a band featuring nothing but incredibly dextrous musicians who play with an enormous level of detail and complexity, it's a shame the director clearly hasn't the faintest idea how to shoot a concert let alone one featuring musicians of this caliber.  hey prince, just so you know....your DIY ""NPGMC"" approach is only impressive if with it you can match what you'd been able to do had you still had the financial might of a major behind you.  if it looks this amateurish then you just look, well...amateurish.  and your talents are not worthy of anything even close to amateur-level presentation.  the bootleggers you despise so much put far greater care into the stuff they put out than you obviously could be bothered to do with this.   i mean really, you re-shot sign of the times in its entirety at paisley park after the rotterdam/antwerp footage was not up to par: i find it hard to believe that original footage was any worse than this.  hardcore prince fans such as myself will want it despite this, but casual fans (especially those not familiar with the more obscure prince material that makes up most of this concert) should definitely avoid.

This is a showcase of Jet Li's brand of martial arts...fast and furious. While this is no Fist Of Legend the movie has enough action to keep the exitement going. What I did'nt anticipate was the humor. Absolutely lots of laughs to pick up where the action stops. Once persons are prepared to judge this movie on it's own merit they will see that this movie was worth buying	1
I often wonder if some if not most of the people writing rave reviews, 5 stars, are really paid, biased, professionals pumping up the movie for increased DVD sales.	0
They just don't have movies like this anymore.  This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen.  This is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past.  Charlie Sheen stars as a man who volutarily goes to war.  This seems odd and he figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was telling them this later in the movie.  He finds out alright.  Keith David plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role.  He cheers him up in a great scene where they get extremely baked.  The supporting cast in this movie is unbelievable and no flat performances here.  Overall this is my favorite movie of all time.  It has stood the test of time and never fails when I want to see a good movie.  I just have the old special edition, not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice.  It has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one from the military advisor who worked on the film.  There is also a lengthy doumentary about the making of and when I saw this I was mroe than glad I got the special edition.  You would nto believe what the actors went through!  It is a great making of. 	1
"This is a rather peculiar film for Seagal, and the first thing that should be pointed out to any Seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film.  Seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief.  In fact, they are extraordinarily brief, though thankfully free of wirefu.  Though Out of Reach is by no means a total failure (it's actually pretty entertaining, Seagal as always is fun to watch, and some of the scenes are well done), the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes.  This film is a drama about a nature nut (Seagal) who roams the forest looking for injured animals.  He has a pen pal in Poland, a young girl, and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her, even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her.  This brings up the main problem with this film, namely, a lot of it simply doesn't make any sense.  It turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring, and Seagal goes through the motions to save her.As per usual with Seagal nowadays, he obviously refused to actually finish the production, and so we have the usual dubbing problem here.  It is even more salient than usual in this picture, however, for here we have not one, but several different people dubbing Seagal's voice, none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him!  Here the most frequently heard fill-in for Seagal sounds like a knock-off Benecio Del Toro with a much higher-pitched voice.  As you can imagine, the effect is very humorous.  As stated above, the main problem with this movie is that it simply doesn't make sense, which was apparently realized by the director, as he has, in many scenes, the voice fill-in for Seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking! How obnoxious! Seagal's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal, which she later uses to communicate with Seagal.  What makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for Seagal, the villian, ineptly played by Matt Schultz, sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for Seagal to find! In one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code.  (Apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means ""This is a trap."")  The villain sees her doing this, and, instead of destroying the message (which would make sense), later has it delivered to Seagal! Huh? In a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling Seagal where she is, the villian sees her doing it, comments on how clever she is, but then leaves the message! There are also quite of few mistakes in this film, several of which are laughably obvious.  At the beginning and end of this film, for example, Seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy, black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head.  During the rest of the film, however, he has short hair.  At the end, after some BS macho dialogue about how Seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing Schultz slowly, each character uncocks his pistol even though Schultz's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock, and even though in the very next closeup Seagal's pistol is still cocked! After a sword fight, which ends on a classic move from older chambara films, notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor, and that then, all-of-a-sudden, there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters.  In the finale, the above-mentioned sword fight, the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than Seagal.  This brings up another frequent complaint of many Seagal fans: his overuse of stunt doubles.  It's almost so bad now that one could say that he doesn't even film his own fight scenes now.  Have you ever noticed that in Lord Steven's early films, when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves? Now what happens? The camera gets as close as possible, shows some shots of his face grunting, shows some arms playing paddycake, then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing Seagal's face.  Ever wonder why? It's because, surprise, surprise, that's not Seagal doing the fighting.   In the gun fight, which is actually a very decent action scene, watch Seagal as he enters the room.  His character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll, which is probably the simplest move in aikido, though it is obvious that it is not Seagal doing the roll.  What is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film, which shows Seagal's character ""roaming the forest looking for injured animals,"" or whatever, it is clearly not Seagal that we see walking through the forest.  Was he afraid that he'd trip over a branch and injure himself? Was he afraid he'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods? I don't know.  What is likely the case is that Seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact, using another actor, in order to make the film work.  I'm really not bashing Seagal, I'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could VERY easily be fixed.  Be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when Seagal goes to the post office.  The postal worker calls Seagal ""Mr. Delacraw,"" or some such bizarre name, even though his character's name is actually Billy Ray Lancing.  Seagal then proceeds to mumble some French to the man, and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent.  This scene is downright strange.  What is also strange is how Seagal is dressed in this scene--like some kind of New Orleans Anne Rice fan, vampire wannabe in a strange, black fur coat.  I don't know, at least it's good for a laugh. If Seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable.  The only truly schocking thing is that this hasn't happened yet.  He shows up late to shoots, leaves early, refuses to finish productions, and yet people keep hiring the man.  He repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production.  He needs to start finishing his films.  In closing, Out of Reach only has two VERY brief fight scenes, but they are somewhat well done.  Seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight, which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human."	0
This is one of the better historical dramas from the 1970s.  Many are stagey and slow, and while this production of MADAME BOVARY is very much constrained to stay indoors, this works to advantage for this story of a woman who feels so trapped by her life and her world.Emma Bovary is not a very sympathetic creature.  She is married to a man who loves her with all his heart, who tries to give her everything she wants, is willing to ruin himself to make her happy, and she still cheats on him and remains miserable.  In short, she is selfish and inconsiderate, as ugly inside as she is pretty on the outside.  Francesca Annis plays Emma.  She is indeed very beautiful.  As an actress she often comes across as bright and hard, flirty and flighty, but cold and self satisfied.  These qualities, of course, are perfect for this character.  Here she seems to be more in love with the idea of being in love than actually loving.  Almost anything to break up the dismal tedium of her life and her disgust with everyone and everything in it.It is very hard for a modern audience to feel sorry for her.  Her daily trial does not include housework or drudgery, she has maids for that.  She is bored because she is useless, she is useless because she is too lazy to seek something meaningful to do; she wants life to be a party, and resents it when it is not.Tom Conti plays her devoted husband, who is completely devoid of ambition, in work or society.  As an actor, Conti often seems to have just woken from a nap, and this dampness is just right for Dr. Bovary.  He too is very lazy in his way, but his seems to stem from ignorance.  When contrasted with Emma's willfulness, her husband seems the infinitely better of the two.  Conti is really fine here as a man completely out of his depth with this racehorse of a wife.  In much the same way, while Annis is briskly carrying every scene, Conti just quietly steals every one of them.  A perfect pairing for these roles.All the actors here are top notch, and the casting a bit off beat, which adds to the interest.  The costumes, especially Emmas, are a luxurious parade of overindulgence.  Absolutely beautiful. While we as an audience enjoy the parade of finery, we can also see how this wardrobe would drive even the richest man into the poorhouse.  The production is topped off with a novel and lovely score of predominantly piano compositions; pretty and liltling, but melancholy and dissonant.Don't let this one get lost in the shuffle, it is worth seeing.	1
"Ray Sawyer (Rick Cramer), Agnes Bruckner (Eden), Laura Ramsey (Rachel), Jonathan Jackson (Eric), and D.J. Cotrana (Sean) star in this scary and bloody slasher movie.Eric and Eden are going through any typical teen romance; going steady one minute, broken up the next.  Eden works at a local truck stop as a waitress. One evening, Ray pulls into the truck stop to get some food.  Known as the local nut case, Ray has few friends and owns a filling station on the edge of town.  Later that same evening, Ray comes upon Eric and Eden on a lonely bridge.  Swerving to miss Eric's jeep, Ray instead crashes into an on-coming car.  The impact of the crash sends the car slamming through the guardrail of the bridge.  The car is now teetering precariously on the side of the bridge. Ray jumps from his truck and goes to the aid of the woman inside the car.  After pulling her to safety, Ray goes back inside to retrieve a suitcase that the woman told him about.  However, both Ray and the car tumble over the side of the bridge and into the water below.  To make matters worse, the suitcase is full of poisonous snakes, who immediately begin striking at Ray.  All that can be heard are Ray's screams as the car sinks.Ray's body is pulled from the water and taken to the local morgue.  But it doesn't remain there for long.  It seems that the woman in the car was a Voodoo priestess, and the snakes were used to ""cleanse"" people by drawing the evil out of them.  Now, the evil venom is flowing through Ray.  Now begins a bloodbath of carnage as Ray, possessed by the power of the evil venom flowing through him, begins to stalk unsuspecting victims.  One by one, he exacts his revenge on Eden's friends until only Eden remains.  Who will win this final showdown; Ray or Eden?I've always been a big fan of slasher-type films, and characters like Freddy from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series, as well as Jason from ""Friday the 13th"".  Ray Sawyer fits the mold of the typical slasher perfectly. The motives are the same; kill as many teenagers as possible, and Ray succeeds in this very well.  I thought the story involving voodoo was well-conceived.  The special effects were good, too.I recommend this movie to horror and slasher fans.  Although the movie is short (only about 80 minutes), there's lots of slashing in a short amount of time.  If you enjoy a good slasher flick, then don't miss ""Venom"". "	1
The movie starts out with our hero, Izo, being gruesomly crucified. Because of his rage towards the ones who crucified him, he travels through time to present day to wreak his vengence on them. Then a bunch of stuff happens that has no relevance to the plot really, including: having sex with mother nature, a woman pulling a sword out of her vagina then izo throwing a rock at her face, being killed several times, a very trippy scene where he is sucked underwater and comes up on the other side of some wedding where he kills the groom and bride then is sucked back, killing little children, killing a group of mothers in the hallway, vampires, being attacked by a swat team, and a random guy singing while playing an out of tune guitar. While he does all this he turns into a demon then finally kills the ones that were responsible for his crucifixion.This movie gets 5 stars because it is so random and has made me mentally insane since watching it and other japanese films like it	1
I SHOWED THIS MOVIE TO MY STUDENTS.  THEY HAD RED THE BOOK AND THIS WAS REENFORCEMENT FORE THE LESSON.  THEY REALLY ENJOYED IT	1
"There is a pattern in Hollywood when it comes to drama/revenge films such as Eye for an Eye.  It is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised.  They are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end, whilst the victim or top-billed actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end.  It is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort, but for this critic it is getting old.  Eye for an Eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film.  From the opening credits of this film, you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end.  The pauses could be guessed, the lines could have been written the night before, and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best.  It was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic, the violins would always shrill around Kiefer, and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere.  This is your typical revenge film with no excitement, no frills, nothing that would make it stand out from the rest.  The late director John Schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films, which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end.Where did Eye for an Eye go wrong?  I don't think I need to count all the ways for you, but some of the bigger issues that I had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters.  I have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic.  What was Sally Field's job?  I know that is a small detail, but it better highlights my complaint that our central family (the McCanns) were not as developed as I would have liked to have seen.  I had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death, yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed.  Ed Harris literally walked through his character, proving that Field's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion.  The only character worth watching, and was developed briefly, was Kiefer.  He was 100% evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end.  Yet, we didn't even know that much about him either (which upset me).  Schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with Eye for an Eye very well, the actors I believe even knew the story and they probably didn't even need to read the script, and the story played it safe from the beginning, but it wasn't what I wanted to see.  I expected film like this to come out during the 80s, not in 1996.  It was pathetic to see name actors like Ed Harris, Sally Field, Phillip Baker Hall, Keith David, and Kiefer Sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan.  Nothing stood out in this film, nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it, and nothing made me feel excited about these actors.  This was a literal ""nothing"" film.  It lent nothing to the cinematic world except (and I stress this a bit) another peg in a very tired genre known as the ""Revenge Thriller"".After watching this film I said to my wife that I thought Sally Field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it, overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements, which made me think of a High School drama production.  It was amateur at best, but she said that is why directors use Sally, because she is known for being overly dramatic.  This is a pure example of a good thing gone badly.  Sally saw success with it once, but as she continues it only creates bad cinema.  There were times during Sally's bigger speeches that I found myself laughing.  I couldn't help myself, but her focus on certain words and clich� reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike.  The same could be said for Ed Harris who obviously has discovered that he doesn't have to play the outlaying father any further in films.  He was completely wasted in this film.  Was there any emotion with him?  I didn't see any.  Then there was the pitiful contribution by Hall and David that begin with intrigue, but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes.  Also, did Mantegna take a class on how to be a one-dimensional clich�?  Urg, his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one-dimensional police officers.  Again, the only actor worth watching was Kiefer because he not only spoke with evil, but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile.  It was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end.  If I have to talk about the story I think I am just going to go mad myself.  Field over dramatized the entire film, thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer.  Did Kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because Field wanted to see him as evil?  That could have been a great avenue for this film to travel, but alas, ole safe Schlesinger didn't take us down that darker path.  I needed more to develop what Hall and David were doing at the support groups, but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers.  This was yet another dark avenue that was not explored.  I felt as if I saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast, yet we chose to stay on the lighted path.  That, coupled with the poor acting, just created a film that didn't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world.Overall, in case it wasn't obvious, this wasn't a good movie at all.  In fact, I could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again.  I thought only horror movies had the stated Scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again, but with Eye for an Eye it became obvious that it the ""Revenge Thrill"" fell into that same pattern.  The only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure, this film did not.  Sally Field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight, while everyone else was forgettable.  The only fun part was watching Jack Bauer play the epitome of evil.  Watch this film for Kiefer, but nothing else.  Skip it!Grade: * out of ****"	0
"This is a godawful movie, a waste of several million bucks by Universal and whoever else was responsible.  They could have paid my salary for my entire career for what it cost them to make this moronic notion to capitalize on what some executive must have decided was the ""sexy"" health club craze of the 80s. Actors doing calisthenics in tights do not a feature film make.  Lucas or Spielberg or a mailroom clerk could have told them so. "	0
"Gotta love the flashback to the sixties that is reflected in every scene of this movie (of course, it was just a product of its time--the mid-60s--it's not a film trying to recapture the era..it IS the era). Still the storyline is slim and the going slow. Interesting scenes appear here and there. The parts are definitely better than the whole. There's an intriguing idea in here it just never gets developed as it should. Actually, thinking about it in retrospect is more interesting than watching it was. It's subtle, I'll grant you that. And a nice character study....and yet....? We were counting the minutes left in the film by the end (""Only 25 minutes left in the film and then we can get back to our lives!"") so that's not a good sign"	0
This Jet Li movie is thus far the best movie since Shaolin Temple as Younger Jet Li. Its awesome surreal fighting creates this Epic feel to the whole Genre of martial arts fighting. Jet Li has never been so swift and so passionate in this movie. It has laughter, suspense, compassion, and innocense. The most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the Witches pawn. This film is highly recommended to those who love Jet Li and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. An Excellent movie to add to the Jet Li collection	1
Believe the good reviews written here about this film. I havent cared much thus far for the movies Penn has directed after this one, I suppose its because I feel this is such a great film, he created a tough act to follow, but even if he never does top it, he can rest easy knowing he has made a great film that will stand the test of time. I like long moody films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed into, and this is one of those. Although, I would say it could have been trimmed down just a bit, as the pace gets just a little too slow in some areas. But overall this is a great movie, with great performances by all, and it packs an after-punch in that you may not really feel how much it has moved you until its over. Im not easily touched by most movies, but this film had tears building up in my eyes ready to roll with the ending credits.  Its without a doubt one of my favorite films. This is the kind of film that reminds you, movies at there best can indeed be considered a work of art	1
I like this video for it's frankness and straight forward approach of a woman enjoying herself. Like yoga, it requires slowing down and noticing how your body feels while your watching it. The energy slowly rises and the woman increases it by playing with the tempo and rhythm of her touches.The quality of her session is unhurried and she is very relaxed and keeps her body still but her finger is moving in synchronicity with her orgasm. I found that in itself very interesting and different.It is refreshing to find a product that is different from the common depiction of women emulating ecstasy but one in which shows a woman actually really feeling what it feels like to create it in her body and show what it looks like.She shows a way of masturbating and stretching the sensation out that can really tweak your reality of how much pleasure a woman is capable of experiencing, a mind bender so to speak, and it challenges the cultural limitations of what orgasm is for a woman and how she experiences it	1
I bought this DVD because I was getting sick of the other DVD's that claim to be pilates workouts. This pilates work out is very imformative and very beneficial. I am actually seeing results from this workout after only 3 weeks.  Karen also keeps you motivated to continue.  Not to mention the benefit of getting two 50 minute workouts for the price of one. Beware that you need a resist-a-ring for one of the workouts though, and those can be difficult to find. Great, great workout and I would recommend it to anyone	1
After having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out, I was extremely disappointed.  The movie very well could be alright on its own merits, but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful	0
Was surprised by the price compared to other movies, but it was worth it	1
This video's only redeeming quality is its excellent pilates instruction.  Like all Stott videos this one takes extra care to explain proper form and technique.  Unfortunately, the aerobics portion is extremely boring and simple.  You just walk in place the whole time with no interesting variations.  If you are looking for a video for a beginner, this one might work for you if you are truly new to exercise and are REALLY out of shape.  Although I consider myself a beginner when it comes to exercise, this video was too easy for me.  I haven't exercised consistently in several years.  However, I do have a moderately active lifestyle.  I walk and hike on occassion and I play with my kids at the park--that sort of thing.  If you have trouble with everyday activities because you are out of shape, this would be a great place to start.  If you are somewhat fit, this video might be too easy for you as well.  You might also like this video if you feel like you have no coordination.  There are no fancy moves at all.  If you can walk, you can do this video.  I like simple steps, but this was too simple.  In general, though, I think you'd be better off saving your money and taking a walk.  Spend your money on one of the other excellent Stott videos that focuses exclusively on pilates	0
If you have not read the book, then this movie may intrigue you. It is quirky and interesting to say the least. As a storyline it does not lack imagination. From Maine to Vienna to NYC and back to Maine, from the Jew-hating German tourists to the radicals and the [...], from one Hotel New Hampshire to another, the dreams of a father and his colourful family unfold in a series of bizarre and at times disturbing events. And life appears to be a fairy tale that we live as we chase our dreams.Now, in relation to the actual book, this movie can be described with just one word: RUSHED. The adaptation is so faithful that it tries to cover almost everything, all characters and all events, thereby failing miserably to project the sentiment behind the eccentric story of this highly unusual family. I could go on and on about how the accurate quotes from the original text fall flat on a screenplay that comes across truncated and patched together clumsily, how the scenes lack emotional depth, how the characters are not given enough time to be adequately developed... but I will instead characterise the whole attempt as noble but short. If the book was a long wave-like function, with a rise to a crest, then a drop followed by a building surge and another rise to another crest, over and over and over again, then the movie was just a cross-section of the top parts of this rollercoaster of a wave-like function, shaving off all the crests and placing them in a two hour blender, where they were shaken and served to please God knows what. Surely not the potential of this fascinatingly bizarre book, nor its undercurrent and extremely subtle magical tone. And it was not for lack of effort. It was for lack of realism on how to put on screen a highly bizzare story in a way that flows smoothly rather than jump spastically between scenes. A mini series would have worked much better for such a faithful adaptation. Either that or a more free-flowing interpretation that could possibly make sense within the 120 minutes that are usually allocated to a motion picture.Thank God for Jodie Foster's and Beau Bridges's performances, who bring Fanny and Win Berry to life. Keep passing the open windows and read the book for a much richer and meaningful experience. As far as this movie is concerned, just toss it out as far as you can. And if you are to keep it, then do so to remind yourselves of how to NOT adapt a great book onto the screen. This is the only reason why I keep mine	0
"I heard so much about Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"", so I bought it at Amazon and watched it.  Wow, this movie is awesome!!  Now I don't know who is my #1 favorite director, Akira Kurosawa or Masaki Kobayashi. This black and white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the music by Tohru Takemitsu.  In addition to these assets, the camera is wonderful.  I pick this movie as one of ""my movies of my life"".  Tatuyua Nakadai was shining in this movie.  I like him more after seeing ""Harakiri"".

"A very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex Christian.We need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general. I wish some brave person would do a film about how Christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective. This film touched on the subject, but it was not really the focus of the documentary.Perhaps we will be ""blessed"" by a further exploration of the subject in the future"	1
This is a must own film! I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Daniel Berhardt is God	1
He's a smart guy and it comes through in the material.  Can't wait till then next DVD release	1
"I bought this DVD because I really adore the Strokes.  Good music, good people, good style...not so good documentary.  Whoever made this video should not make anymore at all!  The strokes were not even in this besides very few pictures & 10 second clips of them & the ""exclusive interviews"" were not that exclusive.  No sound from any of the strokes & no interviews with them...I can go on.  I mean c'mon...a documentary of the Strokes should at least have the Strokes in it, right"	0
"In 1987 and 1988, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER aired and became an instant showpiece for television, a truimphant (but short-lived) series breathing fresh life into nine lesser-known northern European fairy tales and, later, into four timeless stories drawn from Greek mythology. These old folk and fairy tales, mined from countries such as Germany and Russia and compiled in 2 discs here, along with the Greek tales, are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers: John Hurt for the European fables and Michael Gambon for the Greek re-tellings. But, with much respect to Mr. Gambon, who himself does a fine job, it is John Hurt who decidedly draws my attention. Hurt, with the more eye-catching portrayal, is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. It doesn't hurt that the stories featuring Hurt as the host boast clever and sensitive screenplays written by Anthony Minghella, who, nearly a decade later, would win an Oscar for directing THE ENGLISH PATIENT. As such, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER gloriously lives up to its titular billing. John Hurt's performance sparkles with his enchanting delivery as, propelled by his captivating voice and effectively off-kilter mannerisms and abetted by heavy make-up, he evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener in to his stories. Minghella's screenplays are replete with rich, witty wordplay and evocative descriptives that indeed recall to mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up. The kids, of course, won't have that frame of reference, but, still, watching these episodes, it really does feel as if you're sitting around the fire, enraptured at the feet of a master spinner of yarns. Michael Gambon, on the other hand, is burdened with the weightier and grimmer Greek tales. Thus, he eschews John Hurt's light, ebullient touch, opting instead to display a more proper and somber persona. He's pretty good, mind you, but, in the final analysis, he ends up lacking a bit of something when compared to John Hurt. Both Hurt and Gambon, by the way, are accompanied by the same mangy talking dog (as operated by Brian Henson). At a half hour per episode, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER is presented in a marriage of live acting, creative animatronics, and surreal and stylishly vivid imagery. Jim Henson and his crew do a marvelous job with the production values, coming up with excellent special effects (for its time), seamless puppetry, matte paintings, and yeoman make-up work, all to plant the viewer firmly in their fantasy setting. A charming quirk of the series, which adds a nice touch, is the interesting ways the folk tale would continue to make its presence felt during the occasional interludes with the Storyteller and his dog. The camera would cut away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace, but, somewhere in the background, whether it's on a painting in the back or on the surface of a display jar or cup, images depicting the story are set in motion. Pretty neat. The stories themselves are more mature and darker in essence than any kid's fable we're used to over here, especially the Greek entries, and several carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones (""The Soldier and Death,"" ""The Heartless Giant""). But don't keep the kids from watching this series; everyone should get a chance to fall under the spell and feel the power of stories. It does help that most of these tales are little known in the States, thereby giving the viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be actually startled here and there. When was the last time CINDERELLA or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, timeless as they are, offer up anything new? This is just about as perfect as television shows can get; the only flaw I can come up with lies in the dvd set as it comes with no special features whatsoever. ALL the episodes are superb, but if I had to pick the best of the pack, I would definitely go with ""Hans My Hedgehog,"" ""The Soldier and Death"" and ""The Three Ravens."" With several recognizable name actors lending their talents to this series, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER: THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION truly is a MUST HAVE dvd set.**************************************************************************SPOILERS follow. The nine European fables:""Hans My Hedgehog"" - From an early German folk tale: A barren peasant woman, desperately craving a child, naively says aloud that if she had a baby, she wouldn't care what it looks like. Soon enough, she gives birth to a baby who resembles a hedgehog, much to the father's dismay and the scorn of the villagers. ""Fearnot"" - From an early German folk tale: A carefree, absent-minded boy who never scares goes on a strange journey to learn fear. Though still very good, this may be the weakest episode of the lot. Gabrielle Anwar has a tiny nonspeaking role.""A Story Short"" - From an early Celtic folk tale: The Storyteller himself is in the spotlight as he narrates the time he was caught making a fool of the royal cook and, as punishment meted out by the king, must tell one story a day for a year. All goes well until the very last day when the Storyteller suffers from storyteller's block. Brenda Blethyn has a part.""The Luck Child"" - From an early Russian folk tale: Seeking to avert a prophecy which foretells of a seventh son of a seventh son of someday supplanting the current king, the unscrupulous monarch seeks out this luck child and attempts to do away with him. But those blessed with luck cannot be undone...and the same could be said for prophecies. The Soldier & Death"" - From an early Russian folk tale, this is an awesome story. Because of kind acts towards three beggars, an honest soldier returning from war is given a magical sack, a deck of cards, and a nice whistle, which he uses to save a kingdom and to foil Death.""The True Bride"" - From an early German folk tale. Shades of Aslan! A white lion comes to the aid of a girl (Jane Horrocks, LITTLE VOICE) being held under the cruel care of a troll. Co-starring Sean Bean.""The Three Ravens"" - From an early German folk tale: A wicked witch (Miranda Richardson) weds a widowed king (Jonathan Pryce) and then, recognizing that the king's three sons and daughter pose a threat to her ambition, transforms the three sons into ravens. But the princess (Joely Richardson) escapes and is told by her brothers that, unless she remains speechless for three years, three months, and three days, they'll be trapped in their raven forms forever.""Sapsorrow"" - From an early German folk tale: This is a variant on Cinderella (or is it the other way around?) as a beautiful princess (the unimpressive Alison Doody), seeking to escape an arranged marriage, flees to a distant kingdom and disguises herself as a loathsome hag. But, then, she falls in love with the prince...Co-starring Jennifer Saunders.""The Heartless Giant"" - From an early German folk tale: On the whole, giants are benign creatures, harmless to none, unless, of course, the giant hasn't a heart. This story is about a curious prince who is fooled into freeing one such heartless giant from the king's dungeon...The Greek myths: ""Daedalus and Icarus"" - The inventor Daedalus and his son Icarus flee from the wicked King Minos with the aid of Daedalus's man-made wings, but will Icarus heed his father's advice? I'm guessing, not.""Orpheus and Eurydice"" - The musician Orpheus descends to Hades to bring back his dead wife.""Perseus and the Gorgon"" - The hero Perseus faces the Gorgon, Medusa.""Theseus and the Minotaur"" - It's Theseus, with some help from a beautiful princess, versus the savage Minotaur, half-man, half-bull."	1
Amazon.com made sure I received my items in time.  Above receiving the movie in excellent condition, the movie is entertaining and reminds you what real acting is.	1
This is a great tape for anyone who wants a challenge!  You will deinately feel it in the legs.  I have the Ultimate Step Circuit and Burn and Firm and prefer this one as it seems to take you to depletion...until you can't do anymore.  Karen Voight is excellent at cueing and reminding about technique.  Comparable to The Firm Lower Body Split...another 5 star recommendation for feeling the burn	1
"Would the powers that be for heavens sake reissue the Stewart Granger version of ""King Solomons Mines"". He is Alan Quartermain personified and Deborah Kerr is a more than credible female lead. All else is dross. And while we are at it could we also have the same star casting in the fantastic ""Prisoner Of Zenda"". Stewart Granger like many of his contemporaries is under-represented in the DVD revolution."	0
I got my movie sooner than expected. It was in a new like condition. Very nice and thanks	1
Hard to believe it took me until now (February 2007) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made Scarface so popular and award-deserving back in the early 80's. I loved this movie. It really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting, especially Tony Montana. A movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is (over 2 hours). Everyone must see Scarface at least once in their lifetime. It won't disappoint. The ending gave me goosebumps it was *that* good and intense. Watch it now	1
 ( DaviD 1930's MOBSTER)...... This movie is based on the year 1935, The Dutchman's last year of life. It doesn't paint the real picture of the Dutchman or his orginazation. ( Dutch Schultz was a ruthless hot head who didn't entertain a thing. Billy Bathgate was supposed to be Dutch's Protege but was merly an errand boy (No gun play at all). There was almost no gun fights in this movie or the showing of daily operations which was still going on in 1935. There was a apperance by Lucky Luciano which was good but nothing shown of the Commission which Dutch was a part of. The best Dutch Schultz I have seen on Film is (HOODLUM). If your like me and want the real 1930's & 40's minus the watered down or mis leading facts, D your homework before you buy or rent. Or read the review and look for David 1930's mobster)	0

'Clownhouse' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor. While hearing of Salva's conviction when 'Jeepers Creepers' came out, I never knew it had anything to do with this movie, nor had I ever heard of this in the first place. I actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'It', and came across this weird little 'Halloween'-like suspense tale. While the sex scandal never once popped into my head (except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid), I still didn't care for this too much, despite its pluses.Like 'Halloween', this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out, but sadly, it didn't really get to me. If I was about 9 or so, this would've scared the hell out of me. I'm not saying I hated this; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images, but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children, it lost some effect for me. I would have liked it better if I had no idea what was going on, and it would've been a creepier experience.Horror movie fans should like this, even though I personally thought it would be better. The atmosphere is very, very creepy, and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way, but it just didn't do it for me. Rent it first	0
"Dirty Deeds is one of those movies that you sit through saying to yourself, ""this is idiotic"", but instead of abandoning it midway through you find yourself still sitting through it until the credits begin to roll.It's silly. It's a teenager movie. It's been done a million times before in Hollywood (most of the time poorly). Dirty Deeds is one of the sub-par high-schoolers-making-mischief-attempts where if you're perusing cable late one night--and can't find anything else on your 500 channels--is maybe worth a stop if you're determined to watch TV instead of just going to bed.But who knows...you might be seeing the beginning of some great careers! Just look what 1980's teeneager movie Hollywood Knights launched for the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Tony Danza, Robert Wuhl and Fran Drescher. Everybody's got to start somewhere, right?"	0
I saw Tarzan the Ape Man on HBO or Cinemax when I was a teenager and it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was stupid and had no plot	0
Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is a pure example of method filmmaking. It is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker. The art direction, editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable. What drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline, acting and inner message. The inner message evidently enough is that war is hell, or in other words, hell is war. Not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art. European filmmakers wouldn't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war. What is most interesting is that an American filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film's collaborators through the continuance of the film.The plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Martin Sheen plays the role of Captain Willard, a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore. He has a mission and it is to capture a presumed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the Cambodian jungle. Throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences. The most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks. Robert Duvall's character Colonel Kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic American army brain: to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself. The children walk about the playground, oblivious to any danger. The helicopters come into view from the dawning sea; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water, we hear the helicopter's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack. Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries'. It is method filmmaking. The starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing. Let's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which Sheen travels in, stop an innocent upcoming boat, suspecting them to be VietCongs and carrying artilleries. Then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity.This film has its famous moment, some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen. It doesn't require any intellectual understanding, although the film is intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity: to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date. During the current situations of the world, where they are trying to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation. It asks for realism.Enjoy	1
I PLACED A WRONG ORDER AND SO NOW I AM NOT ABLE TO WATCH THE DVD I PURCHASED. IT WAS  FOR AREA NO 1, BUT WE CAN'T WATCH THE NO 1 AREA MOVIES IN TURKEY.THEREFORE I DO NOT HAVE A REVIEW 	0
"""Panic Room"" is a great thriller- Jodie Foster's return to the big screen.  I'd assume most people would enjoy the film itself.  However, the real treat in the 3-Disc Special Edition is the behind-the-scenes footage explaining the wondeful camera work and production in the film.  Any movie lover will be blown away by the creativity and the vision the director brings to this picture"	1
For those of you looking for more Eva action after seeing the original series take heed. DON'T BUY THIS DVD! The Death part of the DVD, part 1, is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season, and the second half, Rebirth, part 2, is new stuff, very good, BUT! If you buy 'The End of Evangelion' you get Rebirth AND a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material. So, don't buy 'Death&Rebirth'. Buy 'The End of Evangelion' instead	0
"Remember Seagal's movie ""Patriot"" where he saves the day with flower petals dropped from a plane. That was bad. This one was by far the worst movie he has ever made. With the dubbed in voice (Why?) to the disjointed plot it should never have been released"	0
"I find it almost incomprehensible in this more enlightened technological age that there are a very limited amount of your subscribers who are concerned about the appaling presentation of all but two of these movies and I also wonder as more and more older movies are being re-released enhanced for widescreen TVs that no one seems concerned that arguably the most classic of classical movie musicals remain in a truncated format that cannot be properly watched if one has a widescreen TV. These movies scream out for the widescreen, they were made with the ultimate technology of the time to be seen as wide and as broard as possible. Yet they remain stuck in a non anamorphic style that limits their enjoyment to anyone with a widescreen TV and, with one exception, all the people who have written about them dont seem to care. ""Oklahoma"", ""Carousel"", ""South Pacific"" and ""King and I"" need to be updated to 16.9 anamorphic widescreen (also preferably with some genuine extras and commentaries as well). Fox are years behind the rest of the movie studios in this regard and have only recently started to adapt their films for the format of the future (ie observe the two versions of ""An Affair to Remember"") of course, this is a major rip off, so anyone with a widescreen TV who has not bought these films --HOLD OFF, coz sooner or later they will get a proper release...How long? That is anybody's guess, but these postage stamp versions are an insult to anyone who knows anything of widscreen DVD technology (""Sound of Music"" is fine and ""State Fair"" was made in non widescreen full screen format, an should be viewed with lines either side of the screen"	0
If you haven't seen this you should. Great movie. Never get tired of seeing it. I think any age could watch this	1
WOW!  I had forgotten how powerful a story was told with a wonderful, haunting score to match.  I'm glad our pleas have been heard!  With new High Definition equipment coming down in price, I can't think of a better movie to view for all with discriminating tastes and those will discover the finer aspects of the cinema.Update:  Is this the Region 2 & 4 version that was released overseas?  If so we are in for a real treat!	1
I didn't know that they made music videos this long. If I had known that's all that this was, I would never have watched it. THIS IS A HORRIBLE FILM! SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND AVOID THIS MONSTROSITY!	0
"I'll give the leads the benefit of the doubt that they're actually a lot better than this lame-o-flick deserves. Kutcher and Murphy are Tom and Sara, the mismatched couple that loves itself to pieces in this story which strains for laughs. After a whirlwind romance, Sara introduces Tom to her tony Beverly Hills family. They marry and the rest (much like their marriage) is quickly history. Things go bad from the wedding night (bloody noses, no sex) and only get worse. After Tom nearly burns down the French Chalet that Sara booked them into (after a fatal misunderstanding involving voltage differences in Europe and an electric sex-toy), and compounds problems by taking them to the worst hotel in Venice (cockroaches, dust and no sex), our heroes quickly realize that they are on the Honeymoon-from-hell. At first they gamely make a go of it, not realizing that they're only saving their tension for the perfect moment.""Just Married"" was a simple idea for a flick. People have been laughing at marriage for years. Maybe that's why the jokes seem forced - the sex-toy fiasco painfully illustrates how far the script will go to get a laugh, and we get that one early on. Every joke is actually half of a joke about Sara and Tom can't have sex, climaxing (really, no pun intended - I mean it!) when Sara tricks custom's inspectors into giving her hated hubby a full-rectal exam (cut to the scene of Tom walking bow-legged onto the plane; obviously he's the victim, but in the perverse logic of this unsexual non-comedy, you've got to wonder whether Tom is actually the victor - he at least got some.) The script can't get past a monumental plot gap: Tom and Sara really don't have anything in common - you'd think they'd have learnt and gotten past their foibles while they dated, but the story skips past much of that. Tom's the hero, but he's an idiot - the script makes him out as the ugly American, an utterly dated cliche (he's surprised that nobody in Europe watches American baseball; he's the kind of idiot who uses ""American"" instead of ""English"" when referring to language - as in ""Why isn't there a sign in American warning against using US voltage sex-toys in France?""  The laughs are far and few in between - the best ones involve cars (both the ridiculous sub-compact they rent in France, and the Dodge Barracuda (at least I think it's a `Cuda) that Tom drives - a monster which was probably meant to remind us about ""That 70's show"" but which looks like a prop from the ""Phantasm"" movies. If ever there was a flick that needed help from ""The Tall Man"", this is it"	0
I always love it when Prevention release another workout because I get bored easy and I like to mix workouts up.  I've loved all of the other Prevention workouts and knew I'd love this too.  Chris Freytag leads again and does another superb job.  There are two aerobic routines and five targeted toning workouts.  The dvd is programmable so you can do them in any order and do as many or as little as you want.  That's a big plus so you don't get bored or pushed for time.  You can choose whether you need to lose weight or just firm up etc.  If, for example, you pick that you need to lose weight, there is a six day week with the routines mapped out for you already.  That is so helpful.  The moves are all basic no frills moves, but they are effective.  The first cardio section is low impact and the second is a variety of low and higher impact moves making it just that little bit harder.  The body parts are all the ones you want to workout; arms, butt, abs and thighs.  All you really need for this dvd is dumbells and a lot of energy.  This is so easy to do due to the programming, so there really is no excuse for not working out.  This can be done by practically anyone.I also love how the other two girls exercising as well, aren't the kinds that yell and shout etc.  They are as professional as Chris	1
These 2 guys playing Harry and Lloyd were so disastrous. They didn't even know how to act corny when they're supposed to. Jim Carrey might be crazy at times but I don't think he's this bad. The whole thing looked like monkeys flying around the screen. Nevertheless, it has some funny moments like when Jessica's parents found all the poo sticking all over the toilet.The whole idea of a 'special class' was just so stupid. Nothing made sense. I didn't see a single point of the whole plot in the first place just to get a little extra cash.The first one was a lot better than this one. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were a lot dumber and a lot funnier. These 2 were worse than dumb and weren't even funny at all.I guess 'Dumb and Dumberer' would be better if it were still Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels starring but nooo, it had to be these 2 who I don't even know. Please don't watch it guys. It may be funny for some guys but it's mostly corny like kindergarteners gone wild. Watch the first one!!!Kirstie Mabita	0
"The movie is a about a guy, who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that. That's pretty much the whole story. Well, the idea is quite powerful but not new, the characters are done in the ""comics"" style and very primitive, the jokes are quite boring. Actually what is really amazing, that it could've been ok to watch as a family movie, but a few really tasteless jokes made it PG13 rated without adding any fun, so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids.Too boring for adults, not appropriate for kids, too much moral for young crowd - I can't really think who might like it"	0
This is possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. The writing and acting, as far as I am concerned, are no better than that of a middle school live performance. The only reason I didn't turn it off was that I was hoping SOMETHING in the movie might help me justify spending $10 to buy it used. That something never came. I would never waste my time on this movie when there are others on this topic that so richly deserve my viewing time investment, such as &quot;Schindler's List&quot; &amp; &quot;The Pianist&quot;. Trust me, PASS IT UP just as fast as you can	0
"Men of a certain age will remember how, when we were kids and this was played on TV in the early 80s, we thought it was so cool when a huge army of police officers fired so many shots into a house that it eventually collapsed, and when a bus was shot full of holes by an even larger army of cops.  But those two over-the-top scenes are all this movie has going for it.  The other action scenes are pretty silly and unbelievable, especially scenes involving a sniper in a helicopter, and atop a parking structure, both of whom were in ""can't miss"" positions and missed anyway.  Moreover, if you know anything about law the plot is beyond silly.  It involves Eastwood being sent from Phoenix to Las Vegas to escort a witness being extradited back to Arizona for a trial.  The witness will testify about bad behavior on the part of the Phoenix police commissioner, and a corrupt assistant district attorney is involved with the commissioner in a coverup.  Assuming a material witness can be extradited, which I doubt, the crime appears to have been committed in Vegas, so it would tried in Vegas, not Phoenix.  And if the ADA prosecuting the case was corrupt and wanted to cover for the commissioner, he could just dismiss the case, and there would be no need to murder the witness.  The idea that they would want to draw attention to the case by having 200 cops line up and try to assassinate the witness is beyond ridiculous.  In sum, the plot and the action were both absurd,and the only interesting scenes were the crazy firepower overkill at the house and on the bus.  But those two scenes probably can't carry the entire movie for the average viewer.  "	0
This is one of the best movies starring children I have ever seen - Ozu embraces their viewpoint - often litterally from their eye level. Often in other Ozu films like 'Tokyo Story', and 'Early Summer' - we would see flashes of children from a strikingly noncondescending and, often times, humerous perspective. Now in 'Good Morning' we have an almost entire film devoted to childhood - and events that are important in the lives of these kids and their parents and family. Like all Ozu films it is gorgeously shot and in a bright colorful style full of wonderfull compositions. It is not as masterul as 'Tokyo Story' of 'Floating Weeds' - but it gives us a better understanding of Ozu and how he saw the world - very charming film	1
One of the most compelling events of the release of Kenneth Lonergan's You Can Count On Me is that it gave visibility to Mark Ruffalo who plays a troubled young man who, unable to deal with the childhood trauma of having lost his parents to a car crash, lives of life of unattached agony and isolation. He's a loner and a drifter, medicating his self-pity with pot and short-lived relationships. His sister Sammy, played wonderfully by Laura Linney, reacts to the same tragedy by being, in many ways, an overresponsible overcontrolling super mom. Two opposite reactions to the same tragedy of course result in a sibling clash. This film shows with great complexity and biting comic insight, the attempt of this brother and sister to shed their defense mechanisms and most importantly reconnect with one another. The ride is never easy in this film. No easy answers are given. Just as important, this film, which deals with the pain of loss, never descends into the maudlin Hallmark movie sap that other films would. Balancing edgy humor and profound psychological insight, Lonergan has written and directed a tale that captures the layers upon layers of psychological complexity that accompany the trauma of loss. Amazingly, he does it in a fast-paced film with scenes that are by turns comic and dramatic. Matthew Broderick, for example, plays a hilarious role of Sammy's neurotic anal-retentive boss at the bank. The conflict between him and Sammy leads to a plot point that I'll let you discover in the film.But most of all, this film shines because Mark Ruffalo plays such an endearing, sympathetic, sometimes infuriating character. You won't forget him	1
I love this old documentary...Capt Clark Gable does an excellent job narrating it, the color footage is a rare treat, and it gives an excellent insight into the day-to-day lives of those from the greatest generation.  It is a real tribute to all the men who flew bombers in WWII and we need to remember their service and sacrifices.  They fought a tougher war and sustained much greater losses than we have in Iraq or Afghanistan, plus they were gone for much longer periods and didn't have the technology such as email or video teleconferencing to keep in touch with their loved ones.  We need to remember them, as we are losing them quickly and soon they may all be gone.  But their legacy remains, and it is films like this one that preserves it	1
I am writing neither to critique the movie nor to eplore the quality of the video or audio. I would simply like to warn potential buyers of the manufacturer defects that I have enconter with TWO copies of this DVD. The first copy was scratched so severly it looked like a fat guy attempted to use it to ski down slopes of rough pavement. So Amazon promptly shipped out another. The second copy didn't have a scratch but the movie hung up in the EXACT same place as the first. ANNOYING! I am currently waiting on another copy, but if it's bad I'm giving up.*IMPORTANT* Consumers, take my review very seriously because I suspect these other reviewers have no experience with the DVD, they're just fans of the film. And what an awesome film it is	0
I cannot believe this is billed as a baby video.  The images have nothing to do with the music and give absolutely no learning or development value. I personally like the Baby Miracle series of videos that give a great baby sized bible message while being very interactive with my baby.	0
  Some scenes are repeated from the first. It is not that bad thats all I can say.  I think I over rated it with 2 stars too many	0

George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time. It's sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys.This whole flick is akin to getting a gift-wrapped packagewrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper... Problem is, as is often the case with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, ain't nothin' inside the package. Get it? These guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever. The word shallow comes to mind. There is nothing there, and I doubt that there ever will be.However, having said that, I must give credit where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis, is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing, same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with Merle Haggard  in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the beautiful Salma Hayek  is also in this, although she hardly does enough. She still had the curves back then.In addition to the above, we could have done without all the obvious and crappy CGI effects at the end. The stuff just doesn't work; never did.By the way, the documentary FULL -TILT BOOGIE is waybetter than the main feature.	0

SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION is an outstanding play transformed to the screen with dignity but with a script that keeps us in the live theatre instead of in a motion picture.  Not that that is a bad thing: the script by John Guare is brilliant.  It simply seems a little static, with its marvelous plays on words, repeated phrases, and disjointed movements significant unto themselves but not really taking advantage of cinematic possibilities of flow.Essentially the tale of how a married couple who deal art (Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland - both in peak form) are so caught up in their superficial lives that they are taken in by a handsome young African American con artist (Will Smith) whose various antics bring the couple round to reexamining their shallow existence.  Most of the story is related over art dealings and dinner conversations and are peopled by such luminaries as Kitty Carlisle, Ian McKellen, artists Chuck Close and Kazuko, Mary Beth Hurt, Bruce Davidson etc - a really fine ensemble.  There are many social comments clustered in this story and it continues to play well after its origins on the stage and fifteen years after the movie was made.  This was one of Will Smith's entries into film as well as one of the gifted Stockard Channing's finest roles.  Highly recommended for repeated viewings. Grady Harp, October 0	1
"While visiting some family in Utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot mid-summer weather.  We ended up renting ""Analyze That"" and boy, what a mistake that was!  We were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to 1999's ""Analyze This.""  The potential was there, it's not as if writers (of course it's never a good sign to see numerous writers) Peter Tolan, Peter Steinfeld, and Harold Ramis didn't have decent material to work with; Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy.  However, this being Hollywood and all, another sequel was botched.  It's because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation.  Despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding DeNiro and some ""fish out of water"" situations, the movie seemed to go downhill soon after.  The jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an over-the-top heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as ""Crossroads.""  Now either they ran out of jokes, they didn't have enough time to invest in an actual story, or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already (""The Sopranos"", ""The Whole 9 Yards"", ""Mickey Blue Eyes"", etc. etc.), that there was simply nothing left to write about"	0
The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style.  For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy.  For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character.  OK, what is one to do?  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie.  This is a SLOW film.  It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it.  I can't recommend the film	0
I was delighted to see more than one shower scene. All natural. Different body types. You will not be disappointed	1
Sorry, after reading some negative reviews I just had to speak up.  This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I still to this day watch it over and over again.  Well directed, some of the best acting I have seen, and my god the cast in this movie, the list of stars is endless.  The courtroom scenes were so intense, I envey anyone who has not seen this yet.  The story was perfect and so many surprises and turns.  Really well done.  This movie is worth every penny, I just wish I would of got to see it in the movies.  It is the most powerful movie I have ever seen, how can anyone say this movie was not good, I guess they just can't handle the truth..	1
What an interesting collection of meditations on the stupefying musicality of Glen Gould. This pianist is from another planet. Classical music has never been so exciting to a rock n' roll fan	1
Really delightful and has stood the test of time.  My recording had a few hic-cups with the lighting in one of the acts.  Music lovely, as were the costumes and scenery Can recommend	1
I first caught The Black Swan several years ago on television and was immediately blown away. Sure, it's just a Swashbuckler, just a Pirate film - with the usual plot, the usual bits and pieces. There's nothing outrageously distinctive about The Black Swan, at least at first sight. Ty Power stars as Jamie Boy, expert pirate who ends up by plot machinations in the employ of ex-pirate and now governer of Jamaica, Captain Morgan Laird Cregar). Morgan's been given a pardon for his dastardly deeds and with his new title attempts to rid the seas of the dastardly buccaneers, sending Jamie Boy off to find George Sanders' Captain Leech. Only there's a twist in the mix - and some dastardly fop's out to make a mockery of Morgan by using Leech as his private pirate to ruin the governer. To make matters worse Jamie not only seemingly disappears - apparently in league with the nefarious Leech, but he also kidnaps the previous governer's daughter, played with feistyness by Catherien O'Hara..... So it's all the usual stuff - kidnapping, sword-fighting, stealing, drinking, pacts with arch enemies and stock characters throughout. But you know what - it's not that you know what you're getting, it's that you get a whole lot more than you ever thought you would. Sure, everything's the same, but somehow strangely different. The story and characters are as seen before - but with the likes of Sanders, Power and O'Hara as the love interest, and the great character actor Cregar playing against type - you have life breathed into the character's that's so often lacking. And the original story by one Rafael Sabatini - who also brought us Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk - is a rip-roaring boys-own adventure. Director Henry King - no stranger to producing similar adventure styled flicks - cracks the picture along with some sense of urgency. It's a spare, fluid film with a simple, but fun, narrative and visual splendour that puts other films, even those made today, out to pasture. This DVD manages to capture that splendour in abundance - the technicolor photography is gorgeously rendered herein, with all of the detailed production and costune design seen at its best. Just check out the restoration comparison to see how good. In addition the disc also features a fine commentary from historian Rudy Behlmer.If you want a cracking piece of entertainment that puts shame to modern counterparts of the genre, look no further	1
The essence of painter Francis Bacon is not a personal life lived on the sordid side but how he was forced to take in life.  Seen through his central nervous system and eyes, we experience  his world of fragments, like collage pieces of existence.  The only place he could make those fragments whole was in a painting. Otherwise, he was wholly inable to put a fully realized human being, himself, together.  Tellingly, one of his best friends comments that he has done a superb one-on-one job with his lover George in his paintings of George.  However, he has been unable to do that in his actual life lived with George!  That sums up Bacon, his art and his life, in a nutshell.  Bacon is not a person you will like but you will understand him and how the fragments of his existence made for great art.  Yet he is also the most alone person imaginable, something no amount of lovers and sordid excess could allay.  One of the very best films about an artist ever made.  You don't need to see the actual finished paintings since it is the fragments he used to build his paintings in his head that matter here.  If you want to see his paintings, you should be able to find page after page of them online in about a minute, or less, using any visual search engine	1
"This is a well-written, thoughtful film. Charlie Hunnam (Pete) really stands out to me - he's perfectly cast, compelling to watch, and completely sells the mentality of a devoted hometown fan who has the back of all his ""mates."" It was especially interesting to watch his relationship with Elijah Wood's character evolve. The whole concept of an American being immersed in the British football scene is a unique one and I think it was pulled off really well. The lessons that Elijah Wood learn and the ultimately sentimental tone of the film make this a must-see"	1
I watched 7 out of 8 episodes in two days.  It may be educational for people who didn't know much about it, but if you are somewhat familiar with the topics, this documentary film didn't offer much more	1
This original version is much funnier than U.S. version. The humor is dry and intelligent, and the characters are very complex: at times, you feel sorry for them; other times, you love them and laugh with them; and mostly, you think they're idiots. What a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience. It's not often I can watch a DVD or series over and over, but this is one that I've enjoyed each time	1
this is a ridiculous overkill of two fascinating characters in the 'lonesome dove'. the whole 2 dvds were just a bunch of idiots kept blabbering, small talking, yammering, blah, blah, blah from the first second to the last minute, just like mcmurty's novels, all the characters were just kept talking, talking, talking in meaningless small talks, almost talked your ears off. it's so controversial and contradictory to those two characters first appeared in 'lonesome dove', gus talked and talked, but call never talked like what was protrayed in this pathetic 'dead man's walk' and the 'comanchi moon', the more logic one is the real sequel, 'the street of loredo', at least gus was dead, and call remained not just silent but more quiet. by watching this horrible movie adaptation from the original book, scripted by the author, the whole movie was doomed to be horrible. because mcmurty simply couldn't omitted those yammering spread all over his original novel, page after page, blah, blah, blah, and we have to find the storyline among those conversations, dialogs, and dug them out of those garbage-like paragraphs. watching this movie was no different. those idiotic morons never kept their mouths shut. blabbering day and night, even during the comanchi attacks. what call showed in this movie and the novel could never developed into a character like what he had become in 'lonesome dove'. because from the very beginning, everybody just quacked and quacked like a school of chickens. drive me nuts. how come these two young characters portrayed in this blabbering novel would and could have developed into the profound older characters in the 'lonesome dove'? once a moron, a coward, an idiot, always would be a one, no matter how old you have become. adding experiences and sophistication in the aging process never happened to a moron, coward or an idiot. how could these two jokes would have survived in that harsh environment is simply beyond me. at least the 'lonesome dove' movie adaptation was  close to what the novel read like. and 'the street of loredo' movie was also an adaptations from the novel	0
"I've seen several pretty funny comedies this year, but none of them could touch what I watched Saturday night. This DVD had it all, slapstick, funny costumes, hilarious sight gags, geeky dancing and more. There were times I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. I just couldn't stop laughing and in fact spent most of the show with tears rolling down my cheeks. It was so funny, that I felt at a couple of points I was going to lose control of my bowels. Yes, it's THAT funny. I highly recommend this one, as it's the closest thing I've seen to the classic Monty Python days of English humor. I don't know when I saw a movie that was non-stop hilarity, without a single moment of serious content. Over two hours of complete madcap behaviour and a near fatal dose of cheese. The name of the DVD? Castles & Dreams, by an English comedy troupe called ""Blackmore's Night"". These guys are like a combination of Monty Python, Benny Hill and Marty Feldman. My sides are still aching..... Those crazy f&^king Brits...."	0
"Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see the appeal of this movie. It's an incredibly small production (3 actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a ""nude scene"" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off."	0
Either you get on the train or you don't... And as long as you continue to get on the train, you'll grasp the meaning of Christmas. The TRUE meaning of Christmas. But you have to be willing to get on. This movie was a great adaptation of the classic story. I must admit I was a tad bit wigged out by the animation. It was just oogey in some ways. Realistic at times and, at other times, so unbelievably fake...I couldn't decide if I liked the animation or not. Still can't. But the story itself is worth the struggle I had with the animation. Get on board! You'll be glad you did.	1
I am from India,and Megadeth is one of the few metal bands with a huge following here.From the few bootlegs of live shows that I did manage to get hold of,this seems to be one of the best gigs ever.Mustaine's singing is as good as it gets live ( if you think it is bad,then you have'nt heard him elsewhere ).But such minor foibles aside,the gig is f'in awesome.The setlist is almost perfect.The biggest pro is that most songs have been improvised.I love that.I used to hate the fact that Megadeth played CD perfect versions of their tracks,which was not fun.I'd rather listen to the CD with better production and singing.But here,they have really streched quiet a bit and given the audience,a stellar musical show.Jimmy De Grasso ( tho' he looks a bit nervous in my opinion ) is unbelievaly tight.He looks like he is appearing for a test,when he's playing the solo on she wolf ( you can see the tension on his face),but wotta solo....the sticks alsmost blur out.The sound and picture quality is great too.My only grouse is that the band has almost no audience interaction and there's very lil bonus stuff on the CD....some soundchecks or pre gig preparations thrown in would have rocked...they need to learn a thing or two from the 'tallica guys about this.But that apart...brilliant gig...a must for any metalhead	1
"""QUINCEANERA""Happy Birthday???Amos Lassen and Literary PrideOne of the great Mexican tardyons is celebrated by the new movie ""Quinceanera"", a traditional rite of passage. It takes place to signify that fifteen year old girls enter the world of womanhood. Magdalena (Emily Rios) is preparing for her party when the movie opens but she has a secret--she is pregnant. She was raised a devout Catholic girl and the fact that she is ""with child"" shames her conservative parents and they retaliate by ostracizing her. Distraught by her banishment from her family, Magdalena turns to her Uncle Tomas (Chalo Gonzales) who lives with her cousin, Carlos (Jesse Garcia) in a small apartment in Echo Park, Los Angeles. Carlos is open with her about his being gay and is being wooed by a new male couple which has moved into the neighborhood. What results is a mnage a trios between Carlos and the couple, one a television producer and the other a British citizen. Carlos bonds emotionally with one of the men and the situation becomes sticky and it jeopardizes Magdalena's new family unit.	In effect the movie takes a careful look at class differences and in doing so looks at the gay characters involved as flawed and it is obvious that Carlos is little more than a sexual pastime for the couple of upper-middle class men. What results is a highly emotional drama that we do not see often in American films but that foreign films seem to have a knack for dealing with.	Performances are excellent in the film and the directors Richard Glatzner and Wash Westmoreland give us a fresh new look on the gay cinema screen. Emily Rios is a charismatic young actress of whom we shall undoubtedly hear more and Chalo Gonzalez as Uncle Tomas gives a performance not easily forgotten. He is warm and laden with emotion that glows in his portrayal.	Everything about this movie is fine, the script, the actors, the photography and the open description of sexuality as well as the sincerity and the love with which it was made.	Awarded several prizes such as the dramatic audience and jury prizes at the 2006 Sundance Festival, ""Quinceanera"" is a marvelous film--especially because it wears its queerness so well, the gay it balances both gay and straight story lines and the way it deals with such important issues as sexuality, maturation, culture clashes and love.Simply put this is an amazing film and should not be missed."	1

"Those of you who remember Ryan Starr from American Idol know why she quickly became ""has been"" material for VH1's the Surreal Life. Ryan Starr also happens to be the worst actress I have ever watched on film, television and or commercials.  The director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of Ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time.  Her dialogue is kept short and simple, and when she does have more than 3 lines at once, the complete lack of feeling, expression & emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile, like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang-nails.  That is all I can say, I would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again"	0

Sometimes I wonder how it is we don't live in a vigilante society.  People do such awful things and alot of times the system really can't/don't do anything for the victims.  Well, in this film, this family was not going to just sit there and let the system dictate how their son's killer would be dealt with.  Story takes place in a small town where the Strout family is a big deal.  You know the family that everyone in the community knows and basically the money makers.  There is also the Fowler family which also make their way in the town.  She is a folk song teacher and the father is a doctor and they have 1 college age son, Frank, that is dating an older woman (Marisa Tomei) and she has 2 sons.  Well, the Strout family's son is married to Marisa Tomei and is not dealing well with the fact that she is dating the college boy and they aren't even divorced yet.  Can't say that I blame him there, but it is inherent that he is a real prick and probably treated her and their sons poorly.  Moving along, the Strout's son kills Frank and because of the Strout's clout and the fact that the ex wife didn't actually see him fire the shot, he is going to get off with manslaughter.  This does not sit well with the Fowler's.  The Fowler's have a friend that has over 300 acres of land, so you can only imagine what happens.  I certainly don't condone vigilantism, however, I just loved the ending.  The Strout family put up property and funds to cover his bail, so since it appeared that he jumped bail, they will lose all of that.  Beautiful!  Then, they were able to get some pleasure from the fact that they will never have to see that jerk again roaming the streets.  I couldn't help but get some satisfaction out of that myself.  Very real and very interesting.  Great movie	1
"Gene Hackman is Jedidiah Tucker Ward, an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good, enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere.  On the other side of this gap of good and evil is Maggie Ward, Jed's headstrong daughter.  Between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people.  The premise suggests the ending - Jed will win the day, but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney.  Jed will fight the good fight (which will require supreme grandstanding) while Maggie learns just how amoral her side really is.What robs this courtroom thriller is what's missing in virtually every courtroom thriller - a case that could go either way, an actual case in controversy.  Maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture, Hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them.  Instead of a compelling case, we have one that's ready for our verdict as soon as we've seen the suits worn by either side or their offices.  The case in ""Class Action"" is one you can typify as ""David & Goliath"", which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power.  There's no way that we're going to see a case won (even by dishonest means) by Donald Moffat's hired band of Harvard-trained professional liars, and there's no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments.  Maggie's bosses are so transparently bad, that not only do they screw up, but even their explanations are patently evil  Even so, the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery, and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless.  For a thriller about high-paid lawyers, ""Class Action"" has all the legal acumen of high-school mock-trial, with fewer suprises"	0
I did not think, that the women Juliet Lewis, plays in this movie was mentally retatrted, i think she just has a disablity.\I hate that lable, if someone can walk and talk, and learn. I don't think so.	1
The Technology on here is great but the storyline is going no where. What's the point? 3000 is creepy as usual and Big Boi's acting is horrible when he's paired against Terrence Howard. They only got 1000 screens nationwide for this movie but it doesn't matter. 3000 screens or 1000 screens, the bottom line is that This movie sucks.	0
"I really loved this dvd. There is some information for everybody, beginners as well as advanced. There is also a nice presence from Paul himself who does not hestitate to retrace the painful and private premices of this album. I was not necessarily a huge fan of his music and knew absolutely nothing of his personnal life and of his method in composing. This dvd, without being too personnal, made me discover the craftmanship of the composer and the depth of the man. I also enjoyed the discovery of the South-African music, their traditions and influence as described by some of the musician of that country. The many footages of the countryside were a pleasure, which worked perfectly with ""Graceland"" songs. The anecdotes are meaningful, witty, funny, deep, depending on the situation. None of them self-indulgent or egotistical. This DVD is a truly great journey with one of the most influential folk composer's. I would rank this DVD up there with ""The Clash, West way to the world"" and""U2, the making of the Joshua tree"". "	1
I had two choices watching this movie...smile or laugh out loud. When I wasn't smiling I was laughing. Keaton's The General is a perfect introduction for those who may shy away from silent movies or who may think silent comics are too exaggerated and mannered. The story line is simple, but what Keaton does with it is genius. Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton) is an engineer for the Western and Atlantic Railroad. He has two loves, his engine, the General, and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), a fine Southern belle. When war starts, Johnny rushes to enlist but is rejected. He's more valuable to the South as a train engineer than he would be as a soldier. Trouble is, nobody tells him why he was rejected. Worse, Annabelle thinks he may be a coward, and tells him she doesn't want to see him again until he is in uniform. Just then northern spies secretly enter the town to steal the General and take it north, destroying bridges and lines along the way, while a Northern army moves south. Unknowingly, Annabelle Lee finds herself on the train and is kidnapped. Johnny sees the General chugging away and races after it, determined to bring back the General. When he realizes Annabelle Lee is held captive, his resolve knows to bounds.For the rest of the movie we are on one of the cleverest, fastest, funniest chase movies ever filmed. Keaton creates slapstick situations and sight gags that not only are funny, but that always are in character and which always are part of the specific plot point. And when he rescues Annabelle and realizes how hopeless her Southern belle helplessness can be, his exasperation is matched only by his love. The General features a big cast, a major battle, fleeing armies, a failing dam and a spectacular moment when an engine tries to cross a burning bridge and everything collapses into a river gorge.Keaton's timing and inventiveness are legendary; so is his risk-taking. He does all his own stunts and some of them were dangerous. In one, he is lying back on the engine's cow catcher while the train is moving at some speed forward. In the distance is a railroad tie across the tracks. Keaton has another railroad tie in his hands. At the last moment he tosses his tie so that the end hits the end of the other tie and they both bounce off the track just as Keaton on the cow catcher passes. This scene has no cutting. The two ties fly off as high as Keaton's head. He could have been killed; instead we laugh. It's amazing that in his older years Keaton could still walk. His body took incredible punishment for the laughs. Try falling hard backwards off a moving flatcar and landing on your back across railroad ties. His ingenuity is extraordinary. How do you build excitement out of an extended train chase? Both engines are behemoths and are on the same track. They can't pass each other. Keaton does it with endless bits of business. In fact, he does manage to reverse the chase at one point in an immensely clever moment combining logic and split-second timing.What makes Keaton so funny and so contemporary is that he doesn't do double-takes. He barely reacts. But he's no stone-face. Keaton's characters are simply very serious fellows. Things happen to them. His characters don't react to events so much as they overcome them with honesty and good intentions.This edition of The General comes from Kino Video and looks good. It includes two Keaton short films, The Playhouse (1921) and Cops (1922). In The Playhouse, Keaton portrays all the members of the cast, orchestra and audience in a stage show, including nine members of a minstrel act, the ladies in the audience and a trained chimp. In Cops, he finds himself in a police chase that is one amazing situation after another	1
if you are a GHITS SAC fan this DVD is a must, series wise the dvd contains 4 new episodes and the tachikoma stories are back as well, in fact the tachikoma's are now back in action in the series Too. Graphic wise, 2nd gig drops the funny pastel look of the first season and returns to its dark look as it was in the first movie, the CG is allot more fine-tuned and the action is awesome!!!, the opener has also improved significantly for the series!!!, Sound wise the series is awesome as usual 5.1 DTS Japanese & 5.1 DTS English, with stereo for both and there are English subtitles if you chose to run it with Japanese audio. Overall they squealed SAC season 1 perfectly, this not a series to miss if you're a shell fan!   	1
"This is a bad movie not only because it doesn't fit chronologically in terms of feel and content.  It's like this film attempts to create Turtles psychaitry 101.  Each turtle attempts to work on and/or completely vanquish their weaknesses.  Leo learns to be a better leader by being a better individual ninja, Mikey learns to be caring and heroic in addition to his usual humorous banter, Raphael learns to control his temper by doing peaceful things while befriending children, and I believe that Donny falls in love.  It's been awhile since I've seen this film so I may have that last thing wrong. More than ten years have passed since I saw this stinker and although I don't remember every minute detail the problems that I had with it are enormous.  First, the time travel plotline is a risky stretch for this series even though the conception of the turtles is vaguely sci-fi. The television series and films haven't really gleamed upon that aspect, instead relying on action, humor, and pseudo wisdom from Splinter to pass off a complete and perfect product.  In my opinion the separate storylines of the Turtles is what ruines the movie and that is the result of the time travel plot. In particular, Leo's and Raphael's storylines simply drag the film down in an obvious way by placing them within contexts they should never be in. The pathos in these scenes is just too thick and is best in this series when it was dished out in moments. They just feel heavy handed.  That's not to say Mikey's plotline isn't just as bad, but he's allowed to get away with some of it because the kids are pretty cute, but the scene with the house burning down is right out of a war movie and is not exhilarating at all.Secondly, the action is just not there as it was before. Sure, it's still pretty bloodless, but the scenes are few and far between and boring. The Turtles have been robbed of their seemingly invincible skills when they work together and the action has been in a more battlefield context so it loses a lot of it's previous effects of catharsis.  It felt like I was watching the History Channel special about the history of the Turtles war in Japan and they lost.  Also, the explosion at the end inside the bell was straight out of a Warner Brothers cartoon and not in character with the turtles. Having the bad guy killed off with the bomb would have been inappropriate too. I'm just the kind of guy who likes(in these kinds of movies) the bad guys to get a death that you don't have to see, or feel the impact of because you can't imagine when their end comes, like falling down a bottomless pit. To me, bombs are out of the question in terms of death.Thirdly, the humor suffers as much as the action because they have little opportunity to do it and when they do it feels forced and is not funny. An example would be a moment when two of the turtles are following, or running from bad guys and they're going up stairs, lots of stairs and Mikey goes, ""This is good for my calfs,"" I was thinking, ""What, is my mom supposed to laugh at that?""  As for the Japanese men who take to American living all too well, none of it is very funny at all and reflecting on it now, it's like saying that just being drunk is funny as opposed to actually doing something funny when drunk, painfully unfunny and pointless.  Equally as pointless was the use of Casey Jones.  His character in the first movie almost steals the show at times, but in this movie he has nothing to do except watch over the Japanese men. In a way this is also doing to him what the film is doing to the turtles, forcing him to work on things that would be better worked out as moments not plotlines.  In this story the writers would have Casey Jones completely emasculated, possibly for laughs, possibly for moral. The former is definitely not the case, the latter is underdeveloped. It's like he says early in film to the turtles asking where are more people to fight, that's what we're thinking for a majority of the film.  In retrospect, the Japanese men might be a parallel for the turtles showing an example of what the writers probably think the turtles would be like if they were completely worthless.  So he has the turtles learning powerful life lessons away from Splinter to show how meaningful and worthy they are to detractors of the series.  I admit, it's a good idea but way too heavy handed.  The meaning is always better in small doses. FINALLY, the song used in the film toward the end with the Japanese men in the bar is such a good song and is very exciting. It was used to great effect in the TV spots for the film to make the audience believe going into the theatre that it was going to an exciting, funny, action-adventure and instead they gave us this stale role reversal film that tarnishes the turtles legacy and insured that there would never be another turtles film. Oh well, at least found out the name of that song"	0
This film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film, and has many flaws:  a silly plot, cheap religious imagery (Dracula is Judas, jeez louise), and not one truly sexy or scary moment. And it wastes three gorgeous gals as Dracula's brides, including Jennifer Esposito & Jeri Ryan. If you can't make a film sexy with these two, you're in the wrong business. Craven has an over inflated rep as a director, he doesn't deserve any rep as a producer, if this leaden film is a sample. It makes the worse Universal horror film look like Citizen Kane in comparison. Save your money and pick up something scary instead, like Bava's Black Sunday or any Hammer horror	0
I'm still waiting for Poldark to make it across the pond. Until then, I'll satisfy myself with this fine work	1
"This is the 6th and last entry in the series Lone Wolf & Cub.  This one not only has a different director than Kenji, who directed 4 of the others, this is the entry most like a comic-book (the series is based on a famous comic book series).Not that that is bad.The whole series fluctuated between great period detail, serious themes, and not taking itself too seriously.  It was at once graphic and fantastic, realistic and wildly improbable,  factual and imaginary. serious & silly.  That's what made it so damn interesting.  Throughout the series the action has taken place in different locales and landscapes of Japan.  Tracing actual historical roads and cities.  Now we end the series in the mountains and the snow, the White Heaven in Hell of the title.This entry has a lot of stuff going on:  Lord Retsudo of the hated Yagyu Clan, Ogami's arch enemy, sends his last child, a daughter to do in Ogami with her ""Falling Dagger"" technique. When, predictably, she fails, he goes to an illegitimate son that was abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe.  The downhill ski battle may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in Her Majesties Secret Service, but it ain't bad.  That Ogami's Baby Cart guns never seem to need reloading etc. are minor quibbles.  If Ogami doesn't shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them, behead them, or run em through.  Red sprays all over the white snow.Anyway, they wind the series up with a bang.  One of the strangest, most unique, and unusual series ever produced anywhere.  Worth it if you don't mind the violence"	1
"Maybe the most engaging documentary ever made. Brilliant style is used in telling the story of one of the giants of the movie industry, producer Robert Evans. Giving magical illumination and motion to still pictures in a way that I could only describe as psychedelic. Being a film fanatic for the last 43 years I was shocked and ashamed to find that I had not heard of Robert Evans. In all my reading of credits over the years I had somehow missed his name. I had remembered seeing William Castle's name at the beginning of Rosemary's Baby but not Evan's. Then, at finding out that he was the driving force behind Love Story, The Godfather, The Godfather Pt.2, Chinatown and one of my personal favorites The President's Analyst and that he was a big reason why those movies were so good, well I was just dumbfounded. And these are just a fraction of the films he's produced.Of course he didn't start as a producer. He had been in women's apparel with his brother and accredited their endeavours as the reason why women wear pants today. While lounging around a pool one day he was discovered by Norma Shearer, lauching his career into show biz. It seems he knows everybody and I mean everybody.After watchng this extraordinary film I called my father to ask him if he had ever heard of this astonishing personality. I queried, ""Have you ever heard of Robert Evans?"" anxiously awaiting a ""No"" so I could tell him all about this amazing show biz entity. He replied, ""You mean Bob Evans."" Yes indeed, it seems he knows EVERYBODY. My father had come across him in his days as a buyer for Macy's. I asked, ""Do you know what he does now?"" ""He's some sort of movie director or something now, isn't he."", Dad answered. I bought him the audiobook. Evans narrates both the documentary and the audiobook, both which are drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name. His voice is almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his prowess. He also lent his voice to the short-lived, hysterically irreverent cartoon series Kid Notorious that still airs on Comedy Central.All in all, whether you know Evans or not this is a fascinating, beautifully made film about a producer whose achievements are arguably greater than Thalberg's and Selznick's combined. The story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends and it goes on and on. This is a must see for anyone interested in Tinseltown. PS:I don't usually care for the added features but these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the documentary are alone worth the price of the disc. What a hoot and more proof that he knows everybody. Ask your dad. Who knows? "	1
This is the final season of Hogan's Heroes. Sgt. Kinchloe (Ivan Dixon) left the series in Season 5 and was replaced by Sgt. Richard Baker (Kenneth Washington). The other original cast members are still up to their wacky antics of outsmarting the Nazis. And, it's still hilarious. Here's a run down of the episodes from September 1970 to April 1971: Episode 1: Cuisine a la Stalag 13Episode 2: The ExpertsEpisode 3: Klink's MasterpieceEpisode 4: Lady Chitterly's Lover: Part 1Episode 5: Lady Chitterly's Lover: Part 2Episode 6: The Gestapo TakeoverEpisode 7: Kommandant SchultzEpisode 8: Eight O'Clock and All Is WellEpisode 9: The Big RecordEpisode 10: It's DynamiteEpisode 11: Operation TigerEpisode 12: The Big BroadcastEpisode 13: The GypsyEpisode 14: The DropoutsEpisode 15: Easy Come, Easy GoEpisode 16: The Meister SpyEpisode 17: That's No Lady, That's My SpyEpisode 18: To Russia Without LoveEpisode 19: Klink for the DefenseEpisode 20: The Kamikazes Are ComingEpisode 21: Kommandant GertrudeEpisode 22: Hogan's Double LifeEpisode 23: Look at the Pretty SnowflakesEpisode 24: Rockets or RomanceIf you have the previous 5 seasons, hey, you might as well get this one!

I am a Jane Austen fan. I love Pride and Prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel. However, Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's most complex and serious novel, and on the whole it is my favorite. Fanny Price is the most difficult of the Jane Austen heroines, not the wittiest or most beautiful, but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong. She is mentored by her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed the point of the book.The acting is okay. The settings are okay. The directing is sad. But the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste	0
I found I did enjoy this movie, even though the director took liberties. It doesn't follow so much the novel by Jane Austen, but if you haven't read the book and are unable to do the comparisons, this movie is enjoyable. I gave 4 stars because of the liberties taken by the director, but did like what I saw	1
My DVD had English subtitles.  The first act is the best.   Watching the young japanese couple interact is very rewarding.  There is so much subtlety and silent communicating.  No surprise, since it is revealed in the booklet that Jim Jarmusch (director) created this movie around the Japanese actress (Youki Kudoh).  'Life is Beautiful' star (and wife of Roberto Benigni), Nicoletta Braschi, stars in the second act.  More great quiet acting.  She is a true beauty.Funny role by the late Screamin' Jay Hawkins.Also appearing in the late Joe Strummer of the Clash	1
Excellent movie that shows how families should be and how most African American families really are. Big Mama's are always the most important component to a family. Definitely a collector's item.	1
"I'm the first to confess that I had never heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 Robert Wise gothic noir, The House on Telegraph Hill, but it doesn't matter, because all the actors are good, and combined with an extremely effective plot, the movie is a terrific tale of murder, deceit and assumed identities in post world war San Francisco. As was the fashion with many noir films of the time, The House on Telegraph Hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the heroine. She tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale, and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened. However, the narrative soon jumps to Germany at the end of the War, and we meet Victoria Kopwelska (Valentina Cortese) is a Polish woman imprisoned in Belsen.With her husband and family dead, Victoria tells the kindly American commander Major Marc Bennett (William Lundigan) that there's nothing for her back in Poland. Desperate to survive, Victoria learns that her best friend has family in the United States, and if they are ever freed, she promises to take Victoria to America with her. Her friend however, is killed shortly before American troops can liberate the camp. With nowhere to go, Victoria hatches a scheme to steal her friend's papers and sail to America, where she learns now the godmother to a young boy Chris (Gordon Gebert), as well as the heir to a sizable fortune, and a gorgeously gothic house high atop Telegraph Hill, following the death of her ""aunt."" Ensconced in the ostensible mansion, Victoria, now dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne marries the boy's guardian Alan Spender (Richard Basehart), partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for security.As Victoria becomes a ""mother"" to the boy, she clashes with his governess Margaret (Fay Baker) and coincidently reconnects with Marc whom she met a Belsen, now a studly a playboy type lawyer.  All the adults are not as they seem: Marc has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money, and Victoria's arrival causes him to draft a new scheme.  Victoria begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good. And then there's the Margaret, the furtive outsider and whether her allegiances to Chris are all they seem. The film is compelling, and tension-fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white. Cortese is especially good in one of her first American roles and as Victoria, she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade, yet through no fault of her own, she steadily becomes a victim of Alan's scheming. Of particular note are the stunning location shots of San Francisco. The main house is just beautiful and the scenes when Victoria is playing baseball with Chris offer stunning views of San Francisco Bay. The House on Telegraph Hill ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers - there's a runaway car, poisoned orange juice, an enigmatic and jealous housekeeper and a false identity. It all makes for a gripping and entertaining film. Victoria starts out as a victim, and although she schemes and lies her way into the house on Telegraph Hill, her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to achieve a kind of redemption for both her and Chris.

The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie, its pretty good itself.  Where else  could you ever hope to see the likes of Captain Nemo, Dorin Gray, Mina Harker, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, Allan Quatermain & Tom Sawyer all in the same movie?  About the only character the production is lacking is Sherlock Holmes.The action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors.  The only real drawback is the length.  About 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes.  All in all, a good popcorn flick. 	1
"From the first time our leading characters' eyes meet, you can feel the temperature rise in the room.  Not your average, sappy ""love conquers all"" type of love story; this film shows the courage it takes to help love conquer"	1
Perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of Lincoln's various works, such as The Sacred Place, The Messianic Legacy, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books. The DVD will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books. However, it is simply not successful as a stand-alone video or as a video about The Da Vinci Code. The narrator, Mr. Lincoln, takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy and the Albigensian Crusade, and points out some interesting details in his wandering. Yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture, and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture. As well, he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals (many inspired, it would seem, by Lincoln's books) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions. I finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark---I cannot imagine what else Mr. Lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour.    	0
"Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, ""The Vanishing"" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, ""what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie"". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie. And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of ""It has to be upbeat!"" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.       "	0
It's been 30 years since I've seen this film on cable.  I decided to re-visit this obscure film and see if I missed anything in the initial viewing.  As it turned out, I didn't miss anything.  It's pretty much the same, routine Sam Peckinpah film, filled with lots of blood, guts, bullets and slow-motion action.  It's also a long, tedious film that is not one of his best, but will satisfy those who enjoy ultra-violence in their movies	0
Our one year old loves this one, and so do I.  The music is wonderful.  The creative incorporation of Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Monet's Masterpieces are entertaining and educational.  The children, little puppets and sequences with toys and nature makes this interesting for our child.  We watch this one most of all the Baby Einstein's that we have.     	1
"Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off, what does virginity have to do with love? & second, who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin? & then Owen Wilson's character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well, that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part about the ""supposive"" gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that ""gay"" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. & then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find this guy ""so"" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to me. u know, I loved the classic, ""American Pie"" that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. & for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it's just an average film"	0

Despite the talented cast this is perhaps the most ridiculous film ever.A goofy hippy copy laughs along the way trying to catch an eleven murder serial killer.This writer did Moonstruck, but this is Moonstink.Seeing Rod Steiger with this material is a tragedy.The case is a joke, the characters are impossibly lame, and the dialogue would gag a collie.This film is worth seeing only to gain appreciatiation for the value of screenwriters.No amount of acting talent can lift this turkey out of the Bankok privey.I just watched this film and at the conclusion I just sat there with my mouth open not believeing how bad the film was.Saradon, Keitel,KLine, Steiger, and Rickman....will try and forget this dog their entire lives. I cannot imagaine how any studio or distributing company let this turkey reach the public.Have I gotten the point accross that the film is weak....I hope so.If I could give it zero stars or even better, minus eleven stars, I would	0

"Synopsis (including Ending):Don Ameche (Gino), a Chicago shoe shine man, is approached by the mafia to go to jail for ""3 to 5 years"" to take the place of their Mafia boss accused of murder because he bears a striking resemblance to him.  They'll pay him yearly and satisfy his lifelong dream of fishing on a boat.   Joe Mantegna (Jerry) takes Don Ameche (Gino) on a 3 day vacation to satisfy his every wish before he's incarcerated.  Joe Mantegna is on probation from the Mob, after disobeying orders from a previous job.  Joe Mantegna goes  ""outside channels"" to take Don Ameche (Gino) to Lake Tahoe to the ""Galaxy"" Hotel where they stay, wine and dine, and try to have a good time.  Things turn difficult when a local real Mafia Boss brings Don Ameche (Gino) to his house as a guest and they form a bond.  The real Mafia Boss has a gathering of crime bosses planned and Don Ameche and Joe Mantegna are caught in the middle.  They escape the gathering and on the day Don Ameche is brought back to Chicago, Joe Mantegna is orderedto kill Don Ameche and make it look like a suicide.  ""It's cleaner this way..."", he's told.Joe Mantegna refuses the order, and the film ends with a Mafia employee testifyingin court and getting sentenced to jail for 20 years to life.The Good:Joe Mantegna is an underrated actor generally and it was nice to see a familiar face inthe real Mafia Boss in Lake Tahoe.  Other than that, there's nothing else going forthis one except a slightly funny scene with the concierge.The Bad:The Mob wants tough guys, right?  This is a comedy, right?  No ones a tough guy and there's no laughs.Joe Mantegna plays a sissy instead of a Mafia tough guy.  Don Ameche plays a senile acting senior with no personality.  I wanted to like this film but I coulden't because it was very slow, very boringand none of the characters were interesting.   We never have a scene with the real Mafia Boss that looks like Don Amecha and the two never meet.  You would expect a friendly ""Thanks for going to jail for 3 to 5 years for me"" but it doesn't happen.At the end someone for the Mob is dressed up like the real Mafia Boss and he'stestifying in court and gets sentenced to jail.  He doesn't look anything like DonAmeche or the real Mafia Boss and yet, he's right there taking the fall.If the film didn't need to depend on Don Ameche's appearance, why didn'tthey send him to jail from the beginning?  The worst David Mamet experience I've had.  Very surprising stinker.The Characters:If Don Ameche played a less passive character he would have been more interesting.If Joe Mantegna showed more conflict as a character with reasons behind them,he would have been more interesting.  As the film stands, they're both flat.Don Ameche had no personality and his only lines are the ones other charactersused.  When a character says something, you can be sure Don Ameche repeats it30 minutes later like a senile robot.  Don Ameche's dialogue leaves a lot to be desired.  Add to that his boring and stale acting in this film. He played very dumb, not interesting, like a real man in crisis about to go tojail for money.Overall, Joe Mantegna was not believable as a Mafia hired hand.   Don Ameche was too passive and uninteresting, and Joe Mantegna is too passive and stale.Scene Criticism:A couple scenes stand out as being very weak and unrealistic.(Gas Station scene where Joe Mantegna is given $3 more in gas than he asked for)Joe Mantegna is working for the mob, and he asks for $1 of gas, and gets $4.  He doesn't have the cash to pay, and when the gasattendant takes the car keys his reaction is ""Please, please, please""A real Mob guy would punch the gas attendant, take back the keys,and leave for the plane they were late for.  A mob guy that won't defend himself for $3?(Scene with Don Ameche offered money to go to jail for 3 to 5 years)Don Ameche doesn't put up a fight or try to leave the room, and is too passive.  We don't learn about his past or his life or family.  There's not enough time spent on the offer, and the scene wasover valued for it's lasting value.(Bedroom scene with Joe Mantegna trying to let Don Ameche escape)Joe Mantegna had no real connection to Don Ameche's characterto justify the scene.  Instead it's 2 strangers.  Personal Commentary:The test for a comedy for me is - ""how many times did I laugh?""This film never made me laugh.  I'm shocked the film costs $24.99 on DVD.  Rent it instead.  It belongs in the $1 bin at Wal-mart.Writing Criticism:Lines like ""He's the guy behind the guy behind the guy behind the guy"" and lines like ""A big man knows the value of a small coin""and the story about the grasshopper and the ant make no sense.The writing is drivel.Alternative Recommended Film:  ""Trading Places"" with Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy and alsoDon Ameche, albeit in a smaller role"	0
"""Above the Rim"" is an entertaining street drama that focuses around Kyle Lee Watson, an inner-city high school basketball player who shows a lot of promise but lets his own arrogance get the best of him.  He won't listen to anybody who offers him advice on how to improve his game, as he thinks that he is the best player ever.  He's been hoping that his mad skills are catching a college scout's attention, but he does catch Birdie's eyes when he plays.  Birdie is a well known gang leader who offers Kyle the good life so long as he plays on his neighborhood team in a ""Shoot-Out"" basketball contest that means the world to him.  Kyle--being impatient as ever--agrees to join, not seeing the clear danger that is in front of him.  A high school security guard with a past knows the danger that Birdie presents, and he is the only who has a chance to get through to Kyle before it is too late.Not only is this a very good basketball movie, but it is also an intense and character-driven drama centered around the choices that we make in life... and how we have to live with them in the long run.  The film has some great performances from Duane Martin, Marlon Wayans and the late Tupac Shakur.  Even though everybody is great in their roles, the showstopper is indeed Shakur.  He gives a very masterful performance that really sticks out and will stay with you long after the movie is over.  My only complaint is the length of the movie.  It's true that a movie that runs a little over an hour and a half isn't short, but I think the story and the characters open more possibilities to add on to the movie.  I think more opportunities and risks could have been taken to further enrich the story.  Still, it is a really good movie that didn't disappoint me.The DVD doesn't have a whole lot to offer.  You can either watch the movie in widescreen or in fullscreen, depending on your preference.  The movie looks and sounds very good.  The only special features that are offered are movie trailers, and those aren't even that great.  I would've loved it if they included the music video, ""Regulate"" by Warren G and Nate Dogg.  In fact, given some of the great rap songs that are in this movie, they could've included a couple of music videos.  It's not a great DVD, but at least it's not that expensive.I really enjoyed ""Above the Rim.""  It may not be flawless, but it definitely does more right than wrong.  The characters are what really dominate the movie.  Even if you're not a fan of the game, it's still something to check out if you're a fan of character drama.  Exciting, intense, conflict-driven and full of heart, ""Above the Rim"" is a very well done film. -Michael Cran"	1
The only reason why I stayed and watched the movie the whole way through was because I paid to see it. Awful movie. Not entertaining at all. It was just so poor. The animation wasn't fantastic. Political messages shouldn't be in children movies. Not a good movie.	0
I saw this film a few years back on TV and really enjoyed it, but I notice it is presented in full screen format. Is this the correct aspect ratio? I hate to buy a botched pan/scan version....can anyone help me out??????	1
"""American Gigolo"" stars Richard Gere of a high priced male prostitute.  He is coasting along with his rich southern Cailifonia clients until one of them is murdered.  When he is considered the main suspect, he goes on the run, with his only friend being the wife of a politician.  At the begining he tells people that he is a moral man,  for example, he dosn't service gays, more on that in a moment.  It is interseting to note that Gere also played in a movie about hookers a decade later in ""Pretty Woman"" and it made a star out of Julia Roberts.  But that is where the similarities end.  This is a much darker story about hypocracy.  When he falls under suspicion all his clients that liked him before all distance themselves from him.  In the end, he finds himself a hypocrit, because in order to get an aliby he is willing to do anything job; gays, S and M, anything to avoid jail.  The only love story here is about him and the politician's wife (Lauren Hutten).  It is complicated by the fact that he will not let anyone in close to him, even for his own protection.  For all it's darkness there is one funny scene.  Richard Gere is called in for a line up at the police department.  He tells the other men in the line up that he got paid, and the others get angry and cause a scene, averting the attention off of Gere.  This is a really good movie as an examination of society's attitude toward sex.  This film was written and directed by Paul Schrader, if that is why it seems like a less brutal companion to ""Taxi Driver"".  Richard Gere is wooden, but his character is cold and icy, so that approach is right.  Lauren Hutten is alright as the bored housewife of a powerful man; she seems sincere in wanting to help Gere.  But I thought the standout performance was Bill Duke as the slezzy street pimp who is quiet but menacing (as oppose to Gere's 'Madam'), but also provides the warning to Gere at the beginning that his 15 minutes of fame are running out.  And another future ""Pretty Woman"" player is present; Hector Elanzo.   He plays the detective on Gere's trail; but he is slimy and rather unlikable here.  Well worth your time, but for adults only"	1
"The Station Agent is a touching, yet off the beaten path kind of flick that I found simply endearing to watch. Fin (Peter Dinklage) has just inherited a train depot somewhere out in New Jersey. Having a passion for trains, he embraces this as his home. However, he only wishes to be left alone and finds that's not as easy to do as he would have thought.First, he discovers Joe (Bobby Cannavale) who has set up a food truck outside his home. Joe is a conversationalist, desperate to talk to anyone and everyone. Next Fin meets Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), who almost runs him off the road, twice. These three appear to have nothing in common, and despite all odds, they form a friendship that is heartwarming to see. All three actors gave amazing performances. Dinklage, as always, commands every scene he is in. I've missed seeing him since the bastards at CBS quashed Threshold, so it was nice to see something with him in it again. Cannavale amused me with his character, Joe, who really needed to ""get a life."" The idea of quite time is not something he can easily grasp to say the least. And Clarkson radiated as Olivia, a character trying to put her life back together again after having lost her son and having her husband leave her. What I liked most about this flick is the honest portrayal it gave us of life through Fin's eyes. There were the chronic stares he got just for being smaller than average. Plus, there was a scene in the grocery store where the cashier didn't even see that he was standing there, so she didn't ring him up until he could get her attention. It just made me think about what it must really be like to not fit in the standard mold physically.All in all, excellent film"	1
P.S. has potential. Both Grace and Linney are great in it, but midway through the movie loses its mystic and gets boring. It's a shame because it could've been a great movie. Great acting with a bland plot	0

House 1 is darker than it's sequels but stll maintains the horror/comedy feel throughout.  Don't expect to be blown away by outlandish Hollywood special effects. The majority of the special effects are not special.  But if you can get over that, you'll enjoy the movie.DVD is pretty bare bones with no amazing special features. I doubt much of that was available due to the age of the film. I'm just happy it was released on DVD!If you are a fan of low budget horror/comedy movies this movie may appeal to you. It's no Evil Dead, but it is an entertaining movie. 	1
"   When you look at the cover, you think it's about a fantastic trip into a Black Hole, and what they find inside, but it isn't. It's about a Nemo wannabe wanting to enter the Black Hole. I especially did not like the ending. Overall I would rate it:Story-3 StarsActors-4 StarsMusic-4 StarsEnding-0 StarsOverall- 2 Stars I am not insulting Disney, I think it came out just how ""they"" wanted it to. And, as with most Disney movies, the only PG part is violence. I liked the actors and the Robots, but other than that, it is a waste of money"	0
This movie is my all time favorite. My friends and my sister enjoyed watching this movie and we watched it over and over.	1
Like the MTM show, Newhart has a style of humor that's timeless, and this show seemed to get better with each passing season	1
As a kid living in Iran, this movie was my favorite though it is an old one.	1
"Absolutely unwatchable. Cliche-ridden. So silly it's very nearly offensive. It's like watching one long music video by a B-level rapper - full of dumb, beautiful women, buff, monkey-headed ghetto thugs, and jokey tricked-out cars. Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is laughable, the acting worse. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are more ""Dumb and Dumber"" than ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". Awful"	0
I ordered this dvd series because I liked Kristy Alleys performance in other movies and series. But this is totally different. A lot of bad language is used and a very adultrous lifestyle is promoted. After viewing two episodes I put it in the trash. Watching this does not make me happy	0

The only reason I'm reviewing this movie now is because I just watched it on TV today. And the only reason I watched it was because nothing else was on. So...No, let's be fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though, because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was proven right.Analyze That illustrates perfectly why `sequel' sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that is why they fail time after time.So what does this movie have? A great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and? Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that. A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile on several occasions. But that isn't enough. There are thousands of comedy films out there; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable, and producers think they'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas. Newsflash: think again. Nobody watches these movies. There's no reason to when you can just watch the original again	0
Better than Submerged, but that's not saying much.  My wife and I have seen almost all of Stevies movies and, next to The Foreigner and Submerged, this movie ranks up there in the Horrid category.What is up with the voice dubbed over when Stevie was mumbling.  We kept trying to guess whose voice that was (Burgess Meredith, The guy who played the other terminator on T2, etc.).  That was the only thing that kept us from turning it off 30 minutes into the film.I can't see why Blockbuster dedicated two rows for this tripe; maybe there are more of us die-hard SS fans than I realized.  Even so, SAVE YOUR MONEY ----DO NOT BUY/RENT/STEAL/VIE	0
"Audrey, without Givenchy, and only a portion of her face visible, few lines and much conflict gives one of the great performances.  The depth of the movie, the richness, amount to a great piece of art.  Certainly, the movie is not ""fun,"" but it attests to a time when a movie about the struggle with faith could be a blockbuster"	1
This movie was the most disappointing piece of garbage I have ever seen.  Aniston's character goes through hell to see this guy wake up and when he finally does and shows her that he is ready to give her what she has been wanting she up and rejects him.  That is total nonsense.  I expected them to get back together in the end.  Real people do not behave like this.  Or maybe they do... it would go a long way in explaining the suicide rate in this country	0
"Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's reality-bending work has become such a Hollywood staple that he is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts. He dares to give dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on horror stories. Directed by Michel Gondry, this 2004 study in love and loss is no exception, as Kaufman takes the notion of a struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one's memory. At the same time, Gondry and Kaufman have injected a strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky.The labyrinth plot focuses on shy, taciturn Joel Barish, who is swept off his feet by the raucous, unstable Clementine. Much to his dismay after a particularly ugly fight, he discovers that Clementine has impulsively decided to erase all memory of her relationship with him through a medical company called Lacuna headed by the benevolent Dr. Mierzwiak. A renowned leader in his field of memory erasure, Mierzwiak treats the heartbroken Joel to the same procedure as Clementine's. However, Joel is overcome by the intensity of emotion from this act of reciprocation and starts rebelling against the deep consciousness treatment to regain his memories of Clementine. The surreal twists and turns that occur boggle the mind of the viewer but not in a way that alienates us from Joel's plight.It helps that a sturdy cast has been recruited starting with a surprisingly subdued Jim Carrey as the depressed Joel. This is easily his most effective attempt at a straight dramatic role even though Gondry allows him to provide flashes of his manic personality when appropriate. Displaying no trace of her corseted Britishness as the bedraggled free spirit Clementine, Kate Winslet shows the right level of abandon and leavens it with her natural earthiness. Tom Wilkinson is his usual steady self as the somewhat remorseful Mierzwiak, while his spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood. All three are fine with Dunst particularly affecting toward the end.The looping narrative could have spiraled out of control had it not been for the stellar work by cinematographer Ellen Kuras, production designer Dan Leigh and editor Valdis Oskarsdottir, all combining to bring much-needed fluidity to initially incoherent scenes. The only fly in the ointment is Jon Brion's overly intrusive music. The 2004 DVD has several extras, the best of which is the consistently informative commentary track by Gondry and Kaufman, which helps explain some of the more bizarre plot turns. There are two featurettes - a standard ten-minute making-of short and a fifteen-minute conversation with Gondry and Carrey that borders on banal. Seven minutes of understandably excised scenes are included, as well as a creative music video of The Polyphonic Spree's ""Night and Day"" and a faux-commercial for Lacuna"	1
"Ok, this is by far the most pathetic taping of a show (although Sweeney Todd comes to a close second).  Where is the show?!  They cut out the ""Glory"" battle scene and just had the actors come out and look happy instead of creepy like they should when they do the slow-mo battle scene (that was not in the movie...).  Also, where is ""I Guess I'll Miss the Man?""  That's a BEAUTIFUL song that was cut from the movie why?  Also what about ""Prayer for a Duck"" and MANY others!!!  This is by far the worst ladies and gentlemen and completely ruins the show created by Stephen Schwartz and the great Bob Fosse!Oh yeah, and Chita Rivera's ""Spread a Little Sunshine"" was pathetic, and the Players did not convince me that they were creepy and really wanted Pippin to do the ""grand finale.""I was in this show and it was the greatest show I've ever done, but this DVD is pathetic.  Don't waste your money on the costly price of $19.99, it should be $7.99 because of how many great songs and scenes that were cut from this show"	0
"Racer takes on a rookie. Wow. We've never seen that before, have we? The worst thing about this movie are the race scenes, many of which resemble a video game. I'd rather watch ABC Sports' ""To Live and Drive the Indy 500."" That's more realistic AND much more fun"	0
"I could not force myself to watch this film in its entirety. I think I made it about 45 minutes in. Despite many fine actors, esp. the always interesting Jeff Bridges, who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles, I simply could not connect and did not care about these people.It was this huge budget American movie shorthand: we're supposed to care because we've been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else, but it just doesn't work for me. If I don't care this far into the movie, it just won't happen.Visually beautiful, and sky high production values on costumes and sets, it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling. Whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces, which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of, but why don't we get faces like that in the major characters. Of course Chris Cooper has that kind of face, but many others (esp. all the ""size 2 women"" in the supporting roles)seem to have stepped out of a commercial.The Chicago tribune called this film ""sleek and beautiful."" I will completely agree with that, but so are music videos. I kept asking myself, what is wrong, what is misfiring? I really wanted to like it. Some of it is the short-hand story telling, but the look was almost too pretty. When the cinematography is this gorgeous, you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper, or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger -a mini-series. Ultimately, I began wondering if the original length was much longer, and it was cut down so much that it became fractured, and if that is the case, my apologies to the director. This is the kind of film that makes me ponder, what is it that European film-makers ""get"" that we lose in our big budget studio films? Is the system itself hurting some films, by sanitizing and conforming them, when they need to stick out like an unruly horse's nose at the starting gate?Very beautiful, but no connection, and not satisfying... well, that's a lot of things in Hollywood in a nutshell, isn't it? There are lots of special features on this DVD, but if I can't sit through the film, I don't care about the extras.  So glad I borrowed this instead of buying it!  I hear the book is something wonderful..."	0
Just can't believe that someone ... with that much money could put out a piece of crap like this!! so so disappointing Paul!!we need a direct live show NO FILM! and direct to DVD without 90%of audience... Pauls pretty taken with his old self!! nice dye job	0
The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable.   I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted.  And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.   If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.  I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.  Rent it first before you buy, and save some money for a classic thriller, like Psycho	0
"When Paul McCartney goes on tour to connect with his beloved audience, it usually for more than just the average ""Oh, I have an album to promote, let me go on tour"".His 1989 tour was Paul's first time onstage in many years, and he used it to show he not only still had the energy and vigor he posssessed during his Beatles & Wings years, but he also still was able to create a deep, personal bond with his audience like few if any other artists can. This spawned the excellent double live album ""Tripping The Live Fantastic"" as well as the exciting concert movie ""Get Back"".His 2002 American tour was a chance for Paul to use the healing power of music to ease the seething sadness caused by the horrific attacks on September 11th. The cd and dvd ""Back In The U.S."" were released to commemorate this wonderful act of musical philanthropy.In 2005, Paul did something that had long been awaited since The Beatles first hit. Ever since The Cold War, The Beatles were a huge phenemenon in Russia. However, there Communist government considered their music alien propoganda, and their music was outlawed. Still, the Russian citizens got their hands on The Beatles' recordings any way they could, and they felt a great deal of inspiration from them, making them belive there was a free world beyond the Iron Curtain.Over 40 years later, Paul ventured to Moscow to perform a historic concert in Red Square to hundreds of thousands of devoted fans who had been waiting all their lives for this moment. The concert was filmed and was aired on A & E as ""Paul McCartney - Live In Red Square"".This is quite simply an excellent concert movie. Paul and his band are in top form. Paul clearly wanted to give the Russian fans a night they'd never forget, pouring his heart and soul as well as his boundless energy into old warhorses such as ""Band On The Run"", ""Live And Let Die"", ""Back In The U.S.S.R."", ""Hey Jude"" and ""Let It Be"", as well as performing rarely heard numbers such as ""Two Of Us"", ""I've Just Seen A Face"" and ""Let 'Em In"".Mixed in with the live performances are commentaries by scholars and fans on how The Beatles' music had such a connection with the Russians during the Cold War, and why they still remained so popular. These interviews manage to come off as insightful and entertaining rather than annoying and unneccessary, even when they occasionally cut off certain numbers.As an added bonus, we get another concert of Paul in St. Petersburg. This is once again an excellent, energetic and fun show that shows why Paul to this day remains quite possibly the most beloved man in the music world.The sound and picture quality are excellent, and the special features are a nice treat. ""Live In Red Square"" is an excellent dvd that belongs in everyone's collection"	1
"I was fortunate not to spend any money specifically on this movie.  I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes... incoherent beginning, and overly stylized particularly where Ashe becomes ""the avenger"" (for lack of a better name).  Nothing like the original at all, which I love by comparison"	0
"Having drooled over the Goodtimes dvd for years now, I did a flip and a half when I saw Universal was releasing a widescreen dvd of this superhot love story. I refrained from doing two flips when I remembered it was Universal and then saw no mention of special features. What? Look at the potential for bonuses! There was an alternate ending, there were deleted scenes, how about a featurette?! Argh! I just wept and wept. And then months later the release date comes, I tear the dvd open and the movie starts automatically - I hit menu and get the nagging old ""operation prohibited by disc"" usually reserved for fast forwarding through those tired old FBI warnings. There's not even a menu! No scene selection. Geez. Do these corporate monoliths now require movies to be no older than 5 days old to have simple menus? I'd like to sit down and analyze the brilliance of Sarandon and Spader, note how Spader's hair changes near the end because of reshoots, but I'm just too raving mad at Universal right now. "	1
"This box set is worth every penny! This is an absolute MUST have if you meet the following eligibility requirements: 1. You have a decent TV (at least 32"") and are able to watch in the dark 2. You have surround/stereo sound 3. You love 3D!!!!!!I bought this set a few years ago but unfortunately I made a BIG mistake. I bought the ""Horror"" collection- which works- except that the movies are horrible and hard to watch. Then a friend of mine turned me on to the three movies in this set recently (Encounter, Alien Adventure, Haunted Castle) and I was simply blown away. Now I can not stop watching these 3D movies!! The movies are all made by NWAVE pictures- and boy- have they done a fantastic job!!!! Informative, fun, and of the highest quality.....this is THE DEFINITIVE 3D package. Kids will love, and so will adults. Also, once you have the LCD shutter glasses, they will work on any ""field sequential"" 3d movie you can get your hands on. These movies are thrilling though- especially the non-stop coaster rides in each one. Do you hear what I am saying?? BUY THIS......NOW!!You can thank me later!!! 100 stars if I could and of course..HIGHLY RECCOMENDED"	1
"The Freshman is a very funny movie.  The central joke is that Marlon Brando plays a godfather type figure in lower Manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the titular character Brando so famously portrayed.    Matthew Broderick is the freshman, an innocent NYU film student, who through some comedic misadventures gets involved with Brando and his ""family"".  The funniest scenes involve a  Komodo dragon  loose in a New Jersey shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy.  The movie has no real violence  and though there are a few mild ""bad"" words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids and families.      "	1
Saw this on the box last night. I sat through the whole thing just to see if it would improve - it didn't. I kept wondering whether this was a radio play that someone had decided to film. The dialogue is wooden, the plot is pathetic, the whole set-up is unconvincing. It looks like something the actors did in a couple of days due to contractual obligations of some sort or maybe to cash in on the whole &quot;Vegas&quot; craze - which ranges from CSI to &quot;The Cooler&quot;. (Incidentally, &quot;The Cooler&quot; is another one to avoid.) I would give this zero stars if I could	0
I have loved thie movie ever since seeing it on late night tv. I had to search a long time to find it on video before dvd was an option and I have been waiting impatiently for release on dvd since my vhs is wearing out. The gradual awakening of young Ta to which girl is truly right for him and Sammy Fong's attempt to disillusion his picture bride are priceless although the latter was often cut out  during late night broadcasts. The ballet is sublime even though you can tell when they switched from James Shigeta to a professional dancer. Afterall, it's the music and the story that make this great.	1
"I do not consider it hyperbole to talk about the second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as scaling operatic heights, culminating with the glorious aria of ""Becoming, Part 2,"" which I still relentlesly tout as one of the ten best dramatic hours on television I have ever seen in my life. I have watched a lot of television and have been teaching classes about this topic for over half my life, so I believe I can make a pretty convincing case. We witnesses the potential of this series in Season 1, when creator Joss Whedon held off on the revelation that the mysterious Angel was really a vampire, who just happened to have a soul and loved the Slayer, until half way through the abbreviated first season. In Season 2, we find out just how far true love can go wrong.Love continues to be a very painful thing for the Scooby Gang, as Cordelia (""Some Assembly Required""), Xander (""Inca Mummy Girl"") and Joyce (""Ted""), find out. Then again, prospects look much better for Willow (""Phases""), although we never really do take the Cordelia-Xander romance (""Go Fish"") to be anything more than a cosmic joke, which does offer up the delightfully twisted ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" as the exception that proves the rule (footnote: Buffy spends most of the episode as the Buffy rat because Sarah Michelle Gellar was hosting SNL that week). Of the off-arc stories, ""Halloween"" and ""Ted"" are clearly the best of the bunch. But when it comes to romance, Buffy and Angel are truly on the road to hell paved with the best of intentions.It is clear in the season premier episode, ""When She Was Bad,"" that things are different. When Buffy dances seductively with Xander, taunting him with her sexuality, the ante has been upped considerably. The pivotal point in the season comes with episode 13 (of 22), ""Surprise,"" when Buffy unknowingly undoes Angel's curse on the night of her 17th birthday by making love to him. Why the gypsies put in the Faustian (in the Goethe sense) escape clause via the moment of true happiness and contentment is debatable, but the galvanizing effect on the show is truly impressive. When Angelus brutally slays Jenny Calendar in ""Passion,"" leaving her body in a grotesque display for Giles to discover in his bed (while opera music soars in the background), it is the symbolic Hellmouth of the show opening up. The audience is shocked into realizing how bad things can get, only the worst is yet to come. Giles's anger buys him one shot at Angelus, but Buffy has to rescue him. They turn on each other in anger, and Buffy actually slugs him to the ground before they collapse weeping in each other's arms. Buffy tells him, ""I can't do this alone,"" but this proves to be most ironically incorrect.Clearly Whedon constructs each season around two half-season story arcs. The first half of Season 2 heralds the arrival of Spike and Dru, and the quick departure of ""The Annoying One."" Of course now we look back and are amazed at what James Marsters has done with the role of Spike, but at this point it is Juliet Landau's ditzy psychotic vampire who provides the flair of the dark side. Whedon brings the first half to a climax in ""What's My Line?,"" the show's first two-parter, where we are introduced to Kendra the Vampire Slayer. It seems Buffy's brief moment of death at the hands of the Master in ""Prophecy Girl"" has some long reaching implications we only begin to appreciate at this point. But with the return of Angelus everything changes. Spike and Drusilla are trying to reassemble the Judge, a grotesque who cannot be killed ""by any weapon forged."" Then everybody learns the truth about not only Angel's transformation but also Jenny's betrayal. Thus begins the deadly game of cat and mouse between Angel and his former allies, which culminates in the two parts of ""Becoming."" Both parts of ""Becoming"" are written and directed by Whedon, and represent the apex of his work on the series. When Angeleus opens the portal to Hell, only his blood can close it, but things are not going to be that easy for Buffy. The dramatic culmination contains the best fight sequence (with swords) in a show that prides itself on innovative staging of its fights, and is an ultimately emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by Sarah Michelle Gellar's slow dissolve into tears while the haunting Sarah McLachlan song ""Full of Grace"" is played. Joss Whedon had set this moment up from the first episode of the series. It is a payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not simply the end of the second season. ""Becoming"" is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television and when you watch the entire second season again you can appreciate how brilliantly this shattering conclusion is set up. The original theatrical film was a teaser, the first season on television was an appetizer, but the second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was epic and once you see this, whether again or for the first time, you are not going to want to stop here. It was also nice to see that the extras went up a couple of notches for the Season 2 DVD collection, especially since we expect more goodies from Whedon and crew, especially given the high quality of ""The Watchers Guide,"" the show's official companion volumes.  There was a lot of thought put into this show, which means any and all insights and looks behind the curtain are greatly appreciated"	1
You might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut...but it's actually the opposite. I really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school.This is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people...This movie is the real thing, i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too	1
Dare I need tell you how greatly this softcore, action thriller sucks?  Ok.  You might think there are two reasons (besides those two) to rent this: Nudity and Hilariously bad acting.  Well, there is nudity, but not as much as you think.  If you're getting it for Anna's naked flesh, be prepared to be more acquainted with your fast forward button.  She's nude, don't get me wrong, in the shower, in the bed, etc., but after that first scene, she is clothed and trying to act for a loooong time before the next scene.  Her &quot;acting&quot; is probably good if you compare to how she acts on her TV show.  she at least doesn't seem stoned. There is a plot that involves...just kidding, I have no idea!  There are some actual actors and a Travolta sibling playing your typical mobsters found in these movies.  The movie only still exists because of Anna being naked in it and there is nowhere near enough of it to make &quot;To the Limit&quot; more than a free rental, if that. I should mention that this is a review for the R rated version.  I don't know if there is an unrated version, but it would have to be better than this.  For more nudity, bad acting, and a less coherent Anna, go rent &quot;Skyscraper&quot;	0
I agree almost completely with JWALKER019. This ugle 1983 production looks like it was from the 1950's and Gianni S. is  downright embarrassing. The costuming there makes everyone look absurd. Tabarro has little passion most of the time but the singing is good. Angelica is okay but it is not a part for Plowright and I definitely did not like Dunja Vejzovic as the Princess.  It is great to have this opera on DVD but otherwise it was a big  disappointment. No goosebumps here. I just finished watching my old tape from 1981 of the Met broadcast with Scotto in all three of the 1 acters. What a delight -- some weak points here and there but it has passion in spades and that's what these need. Scotto was incredible in Suor Angelica. We should be so lucky to have these performances released on DVD but that is highly unlikely.  I've given this La Scala DVD 2 stars but that is probably being generous	0
Eraserhead is filled with strange, uncanny scenes.  What is it to be uncanny? Dictionary.com defines it as having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis; beyond the ordinary or normal; mysterious; arousing superstitious fear or dread; uncomfortably strange.  I would want to define it for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the same time. One has the sense of having never seen such weirdness and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere.  The movie does not have a linear, logical storyline.  It is a mood piece, for want of a better term.  A visual poem, which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen.  If you let your mind play among these images, it will begin to invent meaning for itself.  You may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it.The cinematography is stunning, not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term, but arresting: you simply cannot turn your head away.Will you like it?  Well, I think this is one of those movies you either love or hate.  Think of it as a Rorshach -- how interesting you find it may just depend on how interesting you are	1
"Feeding the cat...those girls shold put on a sweater. Love this movie, 50's detective noir set in 70's California. The beach, the hospital, Mexico, the supermarket, it's all great - and the theme song keeps going throughout over and over. Final scene pays homage to The Third Man, beautiful. A bit of violence, but ""That's how I treat someone I love, and I don't even like you"". Never seen an Elliot Gould movie I like more than this, & it's my favorite Altman as well"	1
most boring of the barbie movies, i am sure glad my daughter has stopped asking to watch it over and over. and when it is so boring it seems to drag on forever. and i agree with another reviewer, princess and the pauper and rapunzel, much better!!!	0
I STILL have not received this DVD.  It was ordered on 12/8/06 and was supposed to ship on 12/12/06.  I am very upset that it did not arrive as it was a Christmas gift.  I cannot rate the product as I don't have it.  I sent an e-mail through Amazon to jrmovies several days ago and have not heard from them.  I would appreciate a response or a refund	0
Thought it would be insightful but it was just dull and low-budget.	0
"Never in my life have I seen a film dedicated to the subject of Vichy France. I had long read about it but knew very little about the official pronouncements of the collaborationist government. I assumed that The Sorrow and the Pity was strictly a documentary about the French resistance, but was pleasantly surprised by its depth. It describes the Vichy of Petain and Laval quite thoroughly. You may recognize some of Ophuls' interviewees from The World at War (such as Edward Spears), but the stand out individual here was the fellow who volunteered for the SS. I assume he served in the Charlemagne outfit. Frankly, I was surprised he was alive and actually showing his face. His point that the slaughter of 1,600 French sailors by the English was a motivating force for him to join the Germans was something I would have never considered. It seems inconceivable back then for the French to have even hesitated siding with anybody other than England--given the competition--but it is clear that Anglophobia was rampant after ""the rout"" of May 1940. The most sensational thing about this film is the footage of the collaborationists. It seems as if modern history has made great attempts to cover up just how much the citizenry backed Petain (at first) and looked sympathetically to the Nazis. The speeches, the newsreels, and the photos are incredibly valuable and terribly interesting- especially if you're a history buff. I'd rank this one right up there with Hotel Terminus."	1
Second straight-to-video sequel to 1995's &quot;The Substitute&quot; has part-time mercenary, part-time substitute teacher Treat Williams taking over for a college professor who was brutally beaten by her juiced-up jock students. Williams and his new team of operatives are out to uncover a steroid scandal linking the university's football team to a local Mafia goon. Pretty good in a dumb Saturday afternoon movie type of way but the third act is more cheesy and full of holes then... well, Swiss cheese, I guess	0
This is my favorite movie. I like it all: screenplay, director, actors, etc. Believe it brilliant	1
"I had not realized what great performers Michael Flatley, Colin Dunne and Jean Butler were until I watched this version of Riverdance. The lead dancers in this version are not in the same league and much of the performance is sloppy compared to previous versions. What made Riverdance great for me was the precision, timing, and dancers dancing togeather in the Irish dance numbers. It is all gone here. Try ""Riverdance: Live from New York City"" or the video tape ""Riverdance: The Show"" instead. This version should not have been released"	0
I was watching Cinemax one night, bored out of my mind and unable to sleep, when this movie came on.  The acting made me laugh.  The premise made me laugh.  Everything about it made me laugh.  Hey, at least it was fun to make fun of anyway.  Just kinda mad that I wasted a good 80 minutes on this piece of crap	0
I had the same problem as everyone else in getting any of the Infantastic dvds from Amazon. I waited over two months, kept getting reassured that they were still coming, and then discovered one day that they had simply canceled my order without letting me know. Not only did no one ever offer to check with the company directly for the source of the problem or actual anticipated wait itme, but Amazon continues to post these items on their web site with a delivery date of 7-11 days, which is at best a misrepresentation, and at worst a complete lie because they are well aware that they can't provide the product at all at this point. I don't really care whose fault it is that the product is never available - Amazon needs to stop posting these dvds for purchase until they are confident the orders can be filled in the time noted.	0
Just a warning to everyone that buys this version of the DVD, it's fullscreen and doesn't have any special features.  Now if you've seen the scenes that weren't included in the extended VHS, but were for some reason on the cable version, you'd see that they were among some of the funniest in the movie.  I'd really like to see this one get maybe a double DVD release with When Nature Calls, souped up and some of those great missing scenes including Ace singing onstage with Cannibal Corpse (funniest scene in the whole movie I thought), Ace conversing with a few drunks in Ray Finkle's hometown and some others.  	0
The ultimate edition of this movie, lots of extras and the image and sound are great	1
Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid	0
"Another product of Hollywood's ""Karaoke Culture"".  In an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind, we have in ""U-571"" an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of ""Das Boot"".  But instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war, we get a cheap flag-waving pile of Hollywood propaganda. The lighting, camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by DB. But the bigoted innacuracies (German submariners machine gunning helpless sailors) and absurd scenarios (an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit) put this ridiculous movie in its own category. U-571 is just another thin, over-promoted, throw-away movie you'll forget the day after you see it"	0
Even though Amanda is quite attractive, the camera work is bad, the lack of professionalism throughout make this naked yoga DVD a bitter disappointment. There are few close-ups and when the camera operater tries to get in close focus goes out the window. A bit of rehearsal may have made the actual yoga scenes a bit better. If you are looking for an accidentally soft focus DVD of a relatively pretty young lady doing joga naked while she discusses what she is to do with the photographer and looking lost, this is for you	0
"It's good to see that in his twilight years, old squinty eyes, Clint Eastwood is growing comfortable playing grouchy old dudes, because, well, he is a grouchy old dude. This movie is anemic from the beginning. Taken from a wonderful novel by Michael Connelly, Clint plays an old grouchy dude who's just gotten a new ticker because his last one gave out while chasing a serial killer. Run, run, run, THUD. Next, new ticker intact, Clint is hired to find the murderer of a cute black woman by her sister, another cute black woman. Oh, and CBW#2 plays the guilt card on Clint, because he's got his new ticker courtesy of CBW#1. So there's a little bit of investigative work, a little but of huffin' and a puffin', and finally Clint discovers who the serial killer is who was responsible for his first ticker giving out and the murder of the donor of his second ticker. Jeff Daniels plays a doofus that lives next door to Clint. What a stretch. Special warning: Clint takes off his shirt yet again in this film as he smooches on CBW#2. It must be in his contract or something. No one, and I mean, NO ONE wants to see saggy Clint with his shirt off. For a much, much better Clint movie, go rent ""Unforgiven"""	0
stay away from all the movies from wesley snipes' and steven seagal's. they are brain-dead movies with brain-dead screenplays, bad directors, bad everythings. this movie, like other viewers' said, drove me nuts. i have to wear straight jacket to refrain myself everytime when i watched these two guys' movies, otherwise i might have crashed my tv set or trashed everything around me in order to vant my frustration. amazon.com should also stay away from selling this crappy movie. god help us.	0
'Torzk' ('Abandoned') is a brilliant Hungarian film written and directed by rpd Sopsits that takes us back to Hungary of 1960 when the oppressive Communist rule altered the lives of everyone, especially children.  The quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring.  It may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended, but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure.ron (Tams Mszros) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce: the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father (Sndor Gspr) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters.  ron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive.  He is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother's blindness by his friend Atilla (Szabolcs Csizmadia) and the two bond emotionally and physically. In this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper Anya (Krisztina Somogyi) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff.  There is one 'teacher' in the orphanage school, Nyitrai (Lszl Glffi) who has been reduced to his position as an 'imprisoned one' by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy. Nyitrai offers  ron solace and introduces his 'fellow traveler' to the glory of the stars, giving ron a map of the heavens that ron cherishes - his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison-like orphanage.  He gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when Nyitrai, in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government, hangs himself. This horrid incident drives ron to organize an escape from the orphanage, an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which ron feels responsible. And the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger.The atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by Pter Szatmri defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in Hungary of that period.  The musical score by Pter Fejcsik, Tams Grgnyi, Ferenc Toma, and Balzs Winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen, making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings.  In all, this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking, acted with depth in every role, and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books.  Highly Recommended.

im a huge fan of writer Sean Mcginly, his classics include Venomous starring Treat williams and Sonic Impact with Ice-T.  Mcginly's films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world, he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film Two Days.  i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast (which included hacks like Paul Rudd) was not in the same league as superstars Traci Bingham and Ice-T who have graced some of his previous work.  Please Sean, stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff, leave that to idiots like Capra, Wenders, Scorcese etc.  They are not in your league.	0
"I enjoyed this wholeheartedly. Mainly because wwe did a little tweak on the formula. Instead of mimicking the one-time use of the Flair dvd formula or using the formula that everyone else gets this three disc sets spreads everything around. All the featured stars get their own video package highlighting parts of their career that made them famous or recognizable. Then every wrestler gets their own match, some of which overlap which makes things interesting. Although we do see some perennial ""best of"" favorites it was nice to see some obscure pieces of footage. Who would have guessed Sal Bellomo would be on a dvd in the 2000's. If wwe continues releases with rarer footage, I think they'll have a better chance at impressing the older members of the fanbase"	1
I'm not a mainstream Beavis & Butthead fan...the fans that jumped on the bandwagon when they became popular.  I was there from the beginning.  Where the hell is FROG BASEBALL and BURGER WORLD.  I want to see BURGER WARS!!!!  There was a time when Beavis didn't even talk he just laughed (heh, heh, heh).  Fire....Fire!!!  I want Season 1,2,3.  Just release them as Seasons....let us be the judge of what is good and what sucks.  I want full episodes with videos included.  EVERY TV SHOW IS LIKE THIS ON DVD.  Why is this one different?!  DEMAND FULL EPISODES AND FULL SEASONS!!! 	0
Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie	0
"It's strange; this just came on FX, and once it was on, I was compelled to stay up and watch the whole thing, even though I've already seen it (in the theatres during its initial release run), and it cost me sleep to watch it all the way through this time around. Even for all of the bad press that this movie got, and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror, this truly is one of my favorites from M. Night Shyamalan - this, along with ""Lady In The Water"" (another MUST have for me), is a movie that I feel compelled to add to my collection. As the other reviewers state, it's not truly scary, but more a suspenseful film, as I actually find ALL of Shyamalan's movies to be. In my humble opinion, he's not trying to provide movies best-suited to Halloween scare-fest marathons, but movies that are suspenseful and thought-provoking. As annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers, there's thought put into each of his films, unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like ""Hostel"" and those damned ""Saw"" movies (enough, already)! At least after seeing this in the theatre, I felt that I'd gotten my money's worth for the ticket price, and this is definitely a movie that I feel I could watch repeatedly. In my opinion, the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to the viewing experience provided by this film. Don't buy this if you're looking for a horror like ""The Exorcist"" - if that's what you want, buy and watch ""The Exorcist"". If you're looking for a film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper meaning, and will have you nodding your head in agreement with the way things play out on screen, buy this movie. Even if you know what happens in the end, I'm sure you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again over time"	1
This is an essential collection for every Al Pacino fan. In Carlitos Way and Scarface he does one of his best work ever. Then there is the performance that gave him his only Oscar so far in A Scent of a Woman. If  you enjoy really good films with a good script and cast you should buy the  Al Pacino collection	1
I found the singing in the soundtrack so utterly intolerable that I had to quit watching this after about 20% of the video. The movie seemed like it would have been nice otherwise (about a 4). The sound of the singing was very grating & harsh to my ears; since it was almost continous it made watching the video impossible. It also seemed to add little to the film in terms of content. The photography & art direction were exquisite	0
My kids (age 5, 7 and 10) love this movie.  I actually bought the VHS version many years ago when the movie first came out but wanted the DVD so we could watch it in the car when while traveling.  My husband and I originally bought this movie for my little nephew to watch so it's nice that we can share it with our own kids now.  If you love animals, this movie is for you.  The DVD jacket says this movie took a few years to make and I believe it.  It's absolutely amazing how the animals relate to each other.  This has got to be one of the best animal films out there. 	1
"I love Dancehall Queen!  I lost my first copy (VHS) so I replaced it with a new copy in DVD.  I never get tired of watching this movie and I consider it a Jamaican movie classic right up there with Harder They Come, Rockers and Smile Orange.  It is a nice twist on the traditional rags-to-riches story.  Although her character's morals are somewhat questionable (she practically ""sells"" her daughter to a high-paying local don), you can't help but root for the protagonist Marcia"	1
This was a delightful view into the highs and lows of courtship, love, jealousy, and hate and what havoc can be wrought by schemes devised to satisfy emotional turmoil. With the lovely backdrop of Italy, all is well that ends well for the characters. Michael Keaton as comic relief is brilliant.	1
A pure and engaging story of redemption amongst family, `You Can Count on Me' tells the story of Sammy (Laura Linney) and Terry Prescott (Mark Ruffalo), siblings who lost their parents in a horrific car crash when they were still very young.  Years later and Sammy is a single mother of 8-year-old Rudy (Rory Culkin), she works hard at her job at the bank, now run by over critical Brain Everett (Matthew Broderick), and she struggles with telling her son just how much of a jerk his father really is (Josh Lucas has a great cameo as Rudy Senior).  When Terry shows up after months of no communication Sammy is immediately thrilled, but shortly after his arrival she realizes her brother is still a screw-up and is just using her, again.Terry shows up in need of money to pay for his girlfriend's abortion, but when his girlfriend tries to commit suicide he decides he needs to take a break from his life and so he stays with Sammy and Rudy.  Over the course of a few weeks Terry has made a deep impact, especially in the life of young Rudy who idolizes him.  This film follows the changes each of these siblings make, changes in themselves but also changes they cause others to make.  It's a beautiful story of redemption and acceptance and it shouldn't be missed.  The performances by the two leads are outstanding, and young Rory Culkin is adorable and mature as Sammy's son, but the real shock to me was Matthew Broderick who played the demanding, philandering, unlikable type brilliantly, and he's not one I'm generally impressed with	1
This is something that both my husband and I love to watch.  We can't wait until season comes to DVD	1
Ed Friedlin is a monthly writer for bass player magazine.  He covers in an excellent way how to slap, pop, mute, develop a groove, how to play with drum machines, ghost notes, and does some licks in larry graham, louis johnson, and marcus miller style and it is laid out in a very good manner.  very good instructional video	1
"Once again, the powers that be at Amazon have chosen to REFUSE to tell us if (in this case) the Darin/Dee flicks If A Man Answers and That Funny Feeling are in WIDESCREEN or not. Pan-and-scan is garbage, and we won't buy it!(That's why I only gave 1 star for now. If they turn out to be widescreen, I'll give them both 5 stars.)""Format: Color"" doesn't cut it. Color isn't a format, anyway - it's a specification or type. Widescreen is a format (as is DVD and VHS, to begin with).So why the deep dark secret about certain movies, Amazon? You list many others as being widescreen, so why do you go on to neglect so many other hundreds, though?If it's a standard screen piece of junk, go ahead and say so, and be done with it, and we'll boycott it. But right now all you're doing by holding back this important information is SLOWING DOWN SALES"	0
This movie is perfect for people in their 40ies and/or 50ies. It just hits the bullseye. Lean back and enjoy the ride	1
The movie is excellent.  I was hoping to find the directors cut with additional footage, but the regular DVD is excellent as well.  Not many additional features, but the movie is delightful and, although slightly longer then some, holds the viewers interest.  Minor amounts of nudity, some very graphic fist fighting, but not excessive and always appropriate to the plot.  One of Ron Howard's best films	1
A dismal disappointment. I think you should rent it and find out for yourself before you actually own a copy. When I see the high ratings, I wonder if people have some investment in the selling of this product. The original Lonesome Dove mini series was unbelievably well done. A complete multifaceted joy. I was so excited when I saw there was a sequel and the joy of Lonesome Dove would continue. Well it didn't and you can read why in more depth in other low ratings	0
"I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's ""performance"" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$"	0
I tried to rent this DVD from an online service about a week ago. Unfortunately, the DVD was damaged and unplayable, but not in the usual way I've seen before (like a disc cracked all the way through). It looked like someone had turned the playable side face-up and tapped a small nail with a hammer on it. The cracks had that kind of splintery pattern like a broken window. Anyway, I returned the copy and ordered another, which I received today. Again, this one is also unplayable and is cracked in an odd way. I just reported this problem online to the DVD rental company and ordered a replacement copy. However, I let them know that they may want to check their inventory of this DVD as someone may be intentionally destroying the DVDs. If I get another one that is cracked or unplayable in any way, I'm going to just buy a copy because the movie must really have gotten under someone's skin for them to do something like that.	1
I heard that the NFL was releasing the past superbowls on dvd, I was excited to say the least. Then I found out these are only highlight films. A real dissappointment to say the least. The films are available in their entirety; why not release them? I was willing to pay well over one hundred dollars for each box of ten super bowls, as were several of the people that I was at a super bowl party with this year. Too bad the NFL fell short again.	0
Imagine someone combining the scripts for Zardoz and Independence Day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing....then you would have Battlefield Earth.It is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars.You become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of John Travolta putting his heart and soul into a project. Just awful. If Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash were humans they would deserve to be executed	0
Like many that have seen this movie, I have been a fan of the video game series for years, and this movie never disappoints me. It has everything that makes RE great; strong characters, interesting story and scenes that make me jump. At first, it is sad that no video game characters make it on to this movie, but Milla Jovovich is great as the heroine Alice. The special effects were really good for this movie. The licker and the dogs were really impressive. The action is also very entertaining. When the action is happening, I find myself not being able to turn away, it is very fast paced. I also really enjoyed the scene when the security lasers were slicing up the team. The Red Queen was an interesing villain as well, maybe even more so than the licker. Overall, this movie is way worth seeing and having if you are a fan or even if you aren't a fan of the games. The movie is just fun	1
"The print looks like you're watching it through muddy water; is this something to do with the unclear ""public domain"" status of this and other of Capra's works?  Doesn't he have a family that could help out his DVDs the way that Chaplin's family has done, or even, to use the opposite extreme, the family of Edgar Ulmer, who have released superlative versions of some pretty dicey movies?  The point is that if people are paying for something they deserve to get it served up nice, and all the various DVDS of MEET JOHN DOE are painful to watch.We've heard for years of the re-worked ending of the film, and that another one exists (or existed at one time).  Bring it on!  For now the pleasure is nearly entirely in watching Gary Cooper react to Barbara Stanwyck's pure life.  It's sort of like BALL OF FIRE but a bit more subtle.  Moviemakers knew they were on to agood thing teaming the two, because Cooper's slow-moving, nearly snakelike screen presence got an injection of caffeine when placed next to Stanwyck's vibrant beauty and her gorgeous clear gaze and complexion.  She doesn't even have to speak, she emanates something very basic in her bones and her posture.  Okay, the movie writes itself into a corner, for what else is going to happen except that if Gary Cooper is not going to kill himself the movie will break the trust it's established with the viewers.  This has always been DOE's problem, that it has to cheat to come out ahead of itself, and it didn't work in 1943 and it still isn't working now.  It's great up until about an hour and fifteen minutes; then you feel the gears start to whine and complain as ""Hollywood"" tries to solve a basically philosophical dilemma"	1
"This movie was much better than ""Vanilla Sky.""  ""Vanilla Sky"" mostly copied ""Open Your Eyes"" but was too obvious and less convincing.  (And Tom Cruise, though good in some roles, didn't fit this role well.)  ""Open Your Eyes"" takes a little longer to draw you in, but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where ""Vanilla Sky"" does. Also, the Jungian Dream aspect in ""Vanilla Sky"" is poorly done, whereas ""Open Your Eyes"" represents the dream experience very well.  I recommend watching both movies before you buy one.  But if you're going to buy, get ""Open Your Eyes."	1
It's not a great movie, but it's a lot of fun.  This is one of those movies that just catches me.  It's quirky and has some decent (for it's day) effects.  There are a feww laugh out loud momments.  Truth be told they are few and far between.  Some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble.  The cast is pretty damn cool, with Urich being upstaged by Ron Pearlman, Angellica Houston, John Mat.. Mattus... The big guy.  Anyway, it's cornball comedy with a basic plot.  Hey what do you want?  It's 80's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been.I still giggle at the time warp battle	1
"*No Spoilers*We had enough of lame Japanese films. This new ""wave"" of horror movies like ""The Ring,"" ""Pulse"" and now ""The Grudge 2"" doesn't seem to have an end. The genre is played out but that didn't stop the producers from creating this sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow-up of the decent 2004 first version. To understand this film--which is nearly impossible until the end--you would have to see the first movie.Brief Story:The film has basically three plots, but in a way they are connected to each other. The first plot is a follow-up of what happened to Karen Davis (Sara Michele Gellar) who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house. Mrs. Davis (Joanna Cassidy) asks her other daughter Aubrey to investigate what happened to her sister Karen. She travels to Japan to bring Sara home. Now in Japan, she finds her in the hospital very paranoid about the ghosts of the house, but something terrible is about to happen.The second plot is about three school girls who visit the haunted house. One of the girls has to go to the closet for some kind of initiation that we don't know about. Suddenly the girl sees the ghost of the child. She tries to get out but the door jammed. They all panic and leave the girl in the closet with the ghost. Unfortunately, they are about to find out the hard way that the place was not to be visited. The third plot takes place in the US where a new family moves to an old building. A young kid suddenly notices that the building is haunted and the ""strange lady"" that lives next door has something to do with it. People are starting to act weird in this building because of the evil presence. Review:Less scary and sillier than the original, ""The Grudge 2"" takes you to a boring and confusion movie experience. The movie suffers from too many plots that confuse the audience rather than scare them. We have to wait until the end to find out how everything relates to each other. This time around the ghosts are outsourcing from Japan to the US. They don't care whether you visit the house or not. Now these menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason. These ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill whoever is on their way--even a young little boy--just to show their rage. The so-called scary moments are not scary at all. They are lame, mechanical and cheap imitations of the original 2004 first version. What's sad is that, this time around, the writers have to make the actresses show some ""skin"" to please the male teen audience. This is what the filmmakers have to use to get some kind of momentum going for this movie.In the technical department the movie doesn't do a good job either. The editing is very sloppy and extremely confusion. We have three plots that are poorly mixed together. Sometimes we are in Japan and sometimes the ghosts are outsourcing in the US. The photography of the film is identical to its predecessor, but that's the only thing that resemblances the original. In the sound department, the movie will make you laugh. We hear sillier noises than the original. Instead of getting scared, you might laugh at the sounds these ghosts make--We personally like the angry ""kitty"" sound.The Verdict:A terrible sequel of a decent horror film, ""The Grudge 2"" could have been a straight-to-video release if it wasn't for the beautiful Sara Michelle Gellar. No scary moments but many funny ones--unintentionally, of course."	0
OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics	0
This boxed set is beautiful. Everything from the box itself to the discs. I have every individual season box, and the show is the most amazing show on Earth. But, I really wan't this Box Set. So tell me, since it was originally  a Limited Edition Box Set, why does it keep popping up here again? Is it not limited anymore? I hope it isn't. Does anyone know	1
Shel Natowsky, Ph.D.This movie is Costner's best, without any hesitation. The performances by Hackman and Sean Young are also flawless. Supporting roles are well honed, as well. The movie has everything you could want in a film...I mean everything! The screenplay is wonderfully written, acted, directed, and presented.Why is it that movies as superb as this one is cannot be made anymore? Everytime I run it, it never ceases to thrill me and to amaze me. If you want to see a Cold War drama that never ceases to excite and one which moves at a fever's pace, then see this one. Satisfaction guaranteed! Well done people	1
...but buyers should be forwarned that the print from which this DVD is made was a poor one, and Alpha Video, the distributors of this classic Capra movie, made no attempt to clean it up.Here we have an example of a key artwork about America's psychological and political framework during emergence from the economic depression of the 1930s, crying out for careful restration to the condition it so  deserves	1
I read over some of the other people's opinions regarding this movie and cannot agree with them about it.  My kids ages 6 & 2 loved this movie from start to finish.  The music, the characters, and the story were great for the entire family.  I definitely recommend this movie for your family's movie collection	1
For sheer excitement, you cannot beat this DVD.  The music is exciting, arranged well for brass ensemble, and recorded with high quality.  But that's only the beginning...In Blast, the band vigorously acts out all the pieces they perform.  How they manage this energy level will flat-out amaze you.  I can honestly say that, after just seeing these performances, you are as happily exhausted as the performers must be.Prepare to be thrilled..	1
This movie is funny and by being so bold in so many ways is refreshing.  It presents realistic characters without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes.  It takes the time to develope the story effectively without boring the audience.  It is a long movie but it moves at a great and effective pace.It is full of laughs.  Joe Pesci is one of the best comic actors of all time.  I don't think that anyone else could have pulled of the part of Vinny nearly as well.  Marisa was great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less than great.  The writing and directing, two things that often get overlooked, was wonderful.  The only weakness?  The case is a little fantastic.  It is hard to believe the coincidences in the movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime.  Of course movie plots don't have to make perfect sense but this stretches it.  Though I usually don't like excessive foul language, this movie uses it in a funny way.  I guess it wouldn't work without it...but don't be mistaken....it has a lot of bad language.  Don't let kids under 17 watch it without supervision	1
I loved the artistic topics of Art & Music in this particular Little People DVD.  And I have to say, this is one of our favorites.  But I do agree with the other reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each DVD.  If you have other LP movies, then you will feel slightly dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and there.  I also agree that the menu setup could be better, with all 10 episodes playing back-to-back, rather than split into 5 at a time the way they currently are.  Otherwise, this is still a great DVD - much better than the LP Storytime Collection	1
I ordered this movie for my husband. He LOVES it! It's a funny entertaining movie and something you can watch over and over. No big plot - but it's got it's moments. I'm quite sure there is something for every European to be offended by... So keep a sense of humor and enjoy	1
This is Arnolds fakiest film.  I mean, a demigod?  I can't believe this at all...fakiest film.  Yes Arnold is in peak condition in this film, but his other films are simply a little easier to swallow...come on Arnold, no one talks back to Zeus	0
"Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more ""progressive"" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting"	0
The magnificent frame employment, accent even more the claustrophobic atmosphere about a man in an unnamed country, arrested for an unexplained crime he is never told about. The unbearable tension joins with bureaucratic struggle to involve us in a nightmare of uncalculated magnitude. Anthony Perkins' emotive memory after Psycho fit with adjusted accuracy. A magnificent cast headed by Jeanne Moreau, Akim Tamirof, Elsa Martinelli and Welles too. A fundamental icon of the cinematography. Footnote: It should be known that a special request of Welles around a documental that included at least some shots of the Atomic Bomb were totally denied to him. Something similar happened with Kubrick when he asked for flight sequences of the B-52 IN Dr. Strangelove.     	1
I saw Transamerica months ago and I still think about it.  There are many reasons, most obviously Felicity Huffman's portrayal of Bree, a man determined to become a woman, trying to close the door on his past, just as it unexpectedly reopens to disclose an heretofore unknown and decidedly lost child.  But Transamerica also brings a funny, poignant, and at times visually beautiful road trip across the United States, in an old car that you wonder how it could make 50 miles, let alone 3000.  It brings unexpected and uncertain romance.  It brings out humanity in all its characters (save one minor one), including Bree's bitter mother.  Finally, it -- plot spoiler here -- concludes with tentative reconciliation, acceptance, and an uncertain but potentially hopeful future.  Transamerica is not loud, not big budget, not spectacular, but there are few movies near as good as it.	1
"This is a thuroughly enjoyable movie; a pleasure to watch. THe acting, characters, and story are entirely plausible, and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors, nor is there any of Hollywood's usual political preachiness (especially unusual considering Robert Redford's backing). THe only downside to the DVD is that it is full-screen, and not letterboxed. THe ""bonus features"" are somewhat lack-luster as well, and the menu system is laughable. Only one actor's credits have been updated since the movie was released, and the credits section is a token gesture at best.Still, this is one of those cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it twice"	1
"Equilibrium is a curate's egg - its best parts are not good throughout, and its worst aspects make erratic appearances. The acting is really the least of its problems; the cardinal failure was a script that could not decide what kind of movie it wanted to be when it grew up.  Equilibrium, however poorly, aspires to be a dystopian film, and there exists a dystopian formula at work in fiction and film alike. Such a formula was employed magnificently in Michael Radford's adaptation of George Orwell's 1984. Contrarily, films imperil themselves in discarding the formula as evidenced by Alfonso Cuaron's junky adaptation of P.D. James' The Children of Men. There are essentially three parts to this formula. First, there must be a depiction of a believable society, and plausible justifications for its existence. The author or script writer must paint vividly, yet remain nuanced, since at this stage his purpose is to show the reader or viewer, without yet telling him the philosophy underlying it. Second, two-thirds of the way through there must be a conversation between protagonist and antagonist, which formally unveils the ethical dilemma. Here, the protagonist offers his alternative, usually an acknowledgement of the humane. Third, the dystopian resolution lies in the protagonist's choice: he must surrender to the system, rebel against it, or be conquered by it. The ending, if it is not tragic in the classical sense, must be ambiguous; if it is ended happily, it is no longer a matter for the reader or viewers' thoughts: the problem has been resolved, and he may retire from it and become forgetful of it. Libria, the society depicted in Equilibrium, is a post-apocalyptic society wherein feeling has been criminalized under the pretext that human feelings, and the actions carried out on their behalf, represent the fons et origio of man's inhumanity to man. The objective of outlawing sentiments is the preservation of peace. Is this believable? Ultimately, it is not because the viewer is given no other reason for this society to exist, no justification for its brutality except that it is by this method alone that peace may be preserved. However, a desire for peace is predicated on an aversion to war, and aversion is something we principally feel. A more believable premise would have been the prohibition of certain feelings, but it is also unbelievable because it is inconsistent. The protagonist (John Preston, a member of the Grammaton Cleric, an elite government agency for enforcing laws against so-called `sense-crimes') marries, begets children, hesitates in killing his partner - what point would there be in any of this in a society that had eliminated feeling? And, if we are being generous, and suppose that this was done intentionally so as to say, ""You can never entirely eliminate feeling,"" it fails still; because if the denizens of Libria weren't completely devoid of feeling, they couldn't be as cowed as they are depicted. Instead, countless times throughout the film characters make comments, statements, enquiries that can only have as their possible source or response an emotion. To have had characters who were truly apathetic, or for whom the fictitious drug Prozium was effective, they would have had more in common with Star Trek's Borg. The backdrop for this dystopia, then, lacks subtlety or nuance. From the first fifteen seconds of film, the viewer ethically objects - it remains tediously Manichean throughout. The viewer is given a straw man and immediately begins tearing it down and the only suspense is literally in waiting for what we know will happen.In Brave New World, it is Mustapha Mond's conversation with John the Savage. In 1984, it is O'Brien's talk with Winston Smith. In The Children of Men, it is a debate between Theo and the Xan. In Equilibrium, the formal unveiling of the ethical dilemma happens in a haphazard way throughout, culminating in a fight scene that lacks the awe inspired by the Matrix three years before. Here was the moment for the ""talky"" bit of the film, the sophisticated counter-punch, the moral awakening, the vindication of the human; instead, the viewer is given another low-brow, Hollywood denouement. John Preston does nothing to justify his alternative to the totalitarian status quo - there is no bit of dialogue with Father where lines are spoken which conveys the notion that ""Feelings are essential to thought,"" or that ""peace has been obtained at a terrible price."" All the loose ends, littered liberally throughout the film, are never addressed: Why have art in Libria? Why does Father intonate, and raise the pitch of his voice to manipulate the masses in a scene reminiscent of a Leni Riefenstahl propaganda film? A better film would have acknowledged these scenes, and defended their inclusion in a climatic dialogue between John Preston and Father (or DuPont as it turns out). The conclusion of Equilibrium can be summarized as follows: ""Good guy kills bad guys, sixty-second revolution ensues, people can feel again, hero smiles, time to go to bed."" There wasn't ever a genuine ethical dilemma anyway: what was wrong was obviously wrong, and what was right was intuitively right. The viewer never believed the reasons Libria came to be, or at least they never found them plausible in the way they found Huxley's, Orwell's, James', Zamyatin's, or Koestler's explanations. In Equilibrium it was all simply the soft groundwork prepared for the banal, unoriginal action movie to follow. The plot, then, was in some respects as shallow as the tendentious storylines in soft-core porn films: they needn't be sensical because no one is interested in the story, but rather for the titillation, arousal, and amusement. Many viewers of Equilibrium are fans of flashy action sequences (a majority of whom were not disappointed as their reviews attest); but for those seeking a fuller cinematic experience, Equilibrium is an unfortunate disappointment. During the film a woman asks Preston, ""Why are you alive?"" Preston responds with the bureaucratically sterile answer, ""I'm alive to safeguard the continuity of this great society. To serve Libria."" ""It's circular. You exist to continue your existence. What's the point?"" she asks. And, what's the point is exactly the point about this film.  "	0
"im not sure why i gave this a second star; maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman (the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious ""adaptation""), this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer (john cusack) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz"	0
"2 1/2 stars.This is a very good concert teaming up a pre-""grammy"" Santana with Wayne Shorter of Weather Report fame. great rhythm section, drums, conga, timbale. top notch musicians, first rate performance, very entertaining. my big problem comes with the quality of the DVD. I don't see the excellent picture others are raving about and when it comes to the audio options even if the back cover states DD 2.0, DD 5.1 and DTS, the menus are showing something else (DD2.0, DTS 2.0 and DTS 5.1) but neither DTS stream seem to be working. only DD stereo works. I own close to 200 DVD's and all work fine, DTS and all. Bought it directly from amazon, I had it replaced and the new one is the same. This is not part of the great Live at Montreux series productions which are all great, no matter how old the concert is.So the 2 1/2 stars overall rating comes from 4 star performance combined with a 1 star DVD quality."	0
This movie was both entertaining and at times, hilarious.  Charlie Sheen is great as the fallen stockbroker turned advice columnist, Denise Richards is funny as his ditzy, shallow girlfriend and Angie Harmon is appealing as the editor of the newspaper.  Also, Jon Lovitz is hysterical as Sheen's plastic surgeon best friend.  This movie is a must for those who want some lighthearted humor.  I highly recommend it.	1
"Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled ""reapeat"".  On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough.  Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor"	0
My boys have grown up with Dave Hood playing all sort of characters like Busdriver Dave, Pilot Dave and Fireman dave. I was excited to get this new DVD as my youngest is crazy for tractors and dump trucks.  Unfortunately, there's a new Dave (kind of like the change that took place in Blues Clues) and it's just not the same.  The new Dave is not bad perse, but after years of Dave Hood's cheesy grin, I can't say that we watch this one much if at all	0
Seth Brundle (Goldblum) is a scientist who might just have invented the world's first teleporter. The only bug (pun intended) is the fact that it doesn't handle flesh and live teleportations. Ronnie (Geena Davis) is a writer for Particle magazine and will stay by his side, documenting via video his attempts to break through. Upon successfully teleporting a baboon, Seth gets cocky and decides to try and teleport himself; a fly slips into the pod while he teleports. At first, Seth finds newfound strength and agility, but pretty soon he's changing for the worst. This is one of Cronenberg's best films, masterfully directed and executed. It's also Jeff Goldblum's finest performance to date! Not content on doing a mere remake (the original Fly (1958) is a much different film starring Vincent Price), Cronenberg brings this film to the next level--literally. It's filled with deep human drama and let's not forget the award-winning special effects! Top notch effects contribute in putting this film ahead of the pack of other mid-eighties sci-fi/horror flicks. The film overall has aged well (it's already been twenty years) if not for the eighties fashion statements.I'm having a hard time figuring out which it is more; a sci-fi or a horror film? I guess it's a fusion of both (I gotta stop these bad puns!). Whether you see it for the first time or revisit it, Cronenberg's The Fly is a great gory, character-driven, profoundly human film. The second disc is chock full of special features: various documentaries and a making-of, screenplays, the original short story on which the original film is based, trailers for all the Fly movies ever made, deleted scenes, and much much more. A must have for any Cronenberg fan	1
Ahhhh, what a great movie.  I cry at the end every time.  I remember when I was young and prayed for the safe return of the astronauts of Apollo 13.  However, I am SEVERELY dissappointed with the widescreen DVD.  Those who created it did not use the original film, but chopped top and bottom from the fullscreen VHS version.  There are many instances when this is evident, but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of the Lovell house after the walk on the moon when Jim says, &quot;I want to go back there&quot;.  When the scene opens, he is cut off at mid-thigh and you never see below his knees. On the fullscreen VHS you can see his shoes.  When I buy the widescreen, I want the WHOLE movie, not less than the fullscreen VHS tape.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  Buy the VHS	0
My wife and I, huge fans of `America's Next Top Model' and `Project Runway', were very excited about seeing this film.  Why it took us this long still baffles me, but as of Friday night we had the pleasure of seeing `The Devil Wears Prada' and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure.  Now, most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of Meryl Streep, and while she was outstanding, this film is more than just a Meryl painted canvas.  There are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise.First is Anne Hathaway who plays Andrea Sachs, a young aspiring journalist who takes a job working as Miranda Priestly assistant at `Runway Magazine'.  Anne Hathaway proves with her performance that she's all grown up.  No, that's not to take away from her more adult roles in more adult films like `Havoc' and the masterpiece `Brokeback Mountain', but here Anne proves that she can do adult comedy, not falling back into her teen goofiness that made her famous in `The Princess Diaries' but keeping everything smart and mature.  She has enough poise and grace to match wits with Miranda, and she does so elegantly.Next up is Emily Blunt who plays Emily, Miranda's first assistant (there are two, Andrea being the second).  Emily has worked her butt off to get to where she is, slaving for the unruly Priestly and it's all about to pay off with a trip alongside Miranda to Paris.  The only thing standing in her way is Andrea, for if Andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly on Emily.  Emily Blunt turns out I think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough sass, enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with her.Stanley Tucci also does wonderfully here as Nigel, Miranda's second in command.  He is there to make sure everything is perfect, and also help Andrea adjust.  Stanley always has done great backup work, playing second hand man to just about everyone, but here he really makes his performance his own and owns it.  He delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but he never feels like the `token gay guy'...he's needed in this film, not filler, and he commands his scenes and really stands out amidst the crowd.And then, of course, we have Meryl Streep who plays the ruthless tyrant known as Miranda Priestly.  What I was most impressed about was the way Meryl underplays every word, every emotion, every scene, which is not what I expected.  I really expected her to go all Glen Close and reincarnate Cruella but she didn't (thankfully) and instead turned out one of the most inspired performances of the year.  She must have had fun playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish editor-in-chief of `Runway'.  She lets us see inside her character briefly (when crying over another failed marriage) but her character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed and so we don't get to see the real Miranda because we're not supposed to.Carried by these four brilliant performances `The Devil Wears Prada' is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and make you smile and will impress almost anyone.  The script is brilliantly adapted from Lauren Weisberger's novel, and while it's not an exact replica (are any adaptations these days?) it carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more approachable and, in my eyes, more enjoyable.  Bravo	1
"This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto ""Semper Eadem"", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history"	0
"Until Sam Raimi made Spider-Man, I think we all regarded Tim Burton's Batman as the best superhero movie (even though I actually don't consider Batman to be a ""superhero"" because he has no superpowers). Burton directed this movie, and did a great job - this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s, except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then. Michael Keaton is Batman/Bruce Wayne. Needless to say, Batman is Wayne's alter ego. Keaton is magnificent at playing the character's alter ego. Keaton also does a good job playing the character when he's not in costume. Keaton's Bruce Wayne isn't as gloomy as Christian Bale's was in Batman Begins, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But I would say Bruce Wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the Schumacher movies. But overall, Bale's Bruce Wayne is superior to Keaton's because Bale has a much more developed character to play. HOWEVER, Keaton plays a better costumed Batman than Bale.The problem with this movie is that the Joker (Jack Nicholson) steals the show - the whole movie revolves around him, so this isn't Batman's movie. This movie should have been called ""The Joker."" So if you ever wondered why Nicholson got a higher billing than Keaton, now you know. The thing is, the writers never bothered to give Bruce Wayne a personality, and they barely scratch the surface of the character's background - we know practically nothing about Wayne. You'd think the guy that's Batman wouldn't be so uninteresting, but we're bored to tears everytime Wayne's onscreen (and out of costume). But when Keaton is onscreen in the Batman costume, Batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes. He plays an even more menacing Batman than Bale - so I say that Keaton does a better Batman than Bale, but that Bale does a better Bruce Wayne than Keaton. But Keaton didn't have anything to work with, so it's not his fault his Bruce Wayne is so weak. But one of the strengths of Keaton's performance is that if you ever met Wayne, he'd seem like the last guy in the World that could be Batman. That's something Kilmer and Clooney failed to accomplish, but thankfully Bale was able to do it.Michael Gough is a delight as the old butler Alfred. It's hard to believe Gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years. I assumed Michael Caine's Alfred wouldn't compare to Gough's, but I was wrong - they're both great. Pat Hingle was really good (as Commissioner Gordon) in this movie. Hingle and Gough were in all four movies of the original series, and I enjoyed them both in Batman Returns. But in Batman Forever I didn't like them nearly as much, and in Batman & Robin I found their characters annoying as hell.Vicki Vale's (Kim Basinger) investigation into Bruce Wayne's background is completely uninteresting. But I already knew what she would find out, so maybe that's why I didn't like those scenes. I also found the Vicki character annoying, screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen. There's lots of little things I love in this movie. The sight of Batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him, (and the terrified expression of the gunmen) with Elfman's dramatic music blaring. The look on Napier's face when he sees the emptied safe. When the guy got fried by the Joker's joy-buzzer (one of the worst deaths I've ever seen in a movie). When the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise, and the Joker's speech right before a mob boss dies. The first Action News report of the movie. The way ""URGENT"" is written in messy crayon on the parcel. When Batman jumps through the skylight (accompanied by Elfman's music). The design of the Batmobile - minor changes make the car even cooler in Batman Returns. When the Batmobile speeds toward the Batcave (again, Elfman's music is awesome). The grin on the young Jack Napier. The Batmobile attacking the chemical factory. The Joker's facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd. When the bat signal is lit - but it's not as awesome as the first time it's lit in Batman Returns, or when it's lit at the end of Mask of the Phantasm.And now a few complaints. This movie featured too many songs by Prince. After a while, they get unbearably annoying. There were lots of other great `80s pop songs that could have (and should have) been used in this movie. Another thing is the Joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up. So I found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring. By the way, you can tell that Nicholson's make-up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking. Burton's Batwing is cooler than Schumacher's Batwing (but not as cool as the one in Mask of the Phantasm). Anyway, the targeting system of Burton's Batwing seems a little screwed up - Batman has a big red target locked on the Joker, but the plane's missiles and machine guns miss their target. And the Joker didn't even try to get out of the way! Looks like Batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems.I always overlooked this movie's flaws (until I saw Batman Begins) for two reasons. First of all, I found Keaton's Batman to be so cool and the Joker to be so entertaining that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie. Second of all, the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is. Pretty much everytime the Joker or the Batman aren't onscreen, the movie is boring.

Statutory rape is NOT funny! Neither  is bad acting or pretentious scripts! (well, okay they are--but unintentionally)..Would have been sexy and funny IF: Oscar was 18.Oscar was not a pretentious ass.Oscar's stepmom was Lena Olin, and Oscar was played by Topher Grace.Gawd! Why can't I get paid to churn out mindless crap like this??? Yes, I could do this movie better. I would dump the steady cam, for starters.AAAH! End pretentious crap movies! just say NO	0
This movie is very simple, and unique. It's the kind of love story which you really believe in while you're watching because it doesn't feel phony. This can be credited to the acting, the situation, and the plot as well. This isn't about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her. That's all been done, and that's what makes this film a breath of fresh air. River Phoenix shows why he is missed by so many, and really allows you to connect with his character. I recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art, and be touched at the same time	1

"I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development. My baby watched about two mintues and was gone. I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children. None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big ""thumbs down"". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They're awesome!"	0
"I watched this film yesterday at a library, and found its lack of depth and analysis to be dumbfounding.  During the first minute, they tell how the revolution began when high bread prices sparked a violent uprising.  During the next 99 minutes they narrate the chronological events of increasing violence, using acted scenes, fake blood and sound bytes from ""scholars"", to give a ""play-by-play"" summary of the carnage and beheadings, leading up to a mention of Napoleon.  During the last thirty seconds, they surprisingly conclude by saying that the French Revolution was a very good thing, because it inspired China and Vietnam and because Louis was a tyrant.  Prior to this little or no mention had been made of Louis' tyranny, although the film had dwelt on his  bedroom difficulties in some detail and also mentioned his weight problem a few times.  After watching 90 minutes of bloody scenes, I found the films conclusion that the French Revolution was a good thing to be an incomprehensible non sequitur.  I would have liked to have seen some historical analysis to support this conclusion"	0
"While some critics can argue with Dan Brown's research and reasoning on certain historical points, one thing these Da Vinci ""debunking"" presentations will never be able to refute is this: the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and Christianity, primarily by the Catholic Church, and the fact that the Church still considered Mary Magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago: 1969. Nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the Church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that Dan Brown has brought out in the open for serious review. This institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the Light, when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals. Dan Brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago, with help from Peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still, quite frankly, shocking and debasing. Sorry, but upon this ""Rock"" of male dominancy was built the Church.Thank you again, Dan Brown, by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations, obscurations and lies. These obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty, insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses, and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources, worth trillions, through guilt, control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power. And those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty Dan Browns put together. People are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been Jesus' actual relationship with the women in his life--or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive Men's Club with Jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship? To answer these questions, some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth, because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page, especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption. The next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the Vatican thrown open for public view. Lord only knows what plunder they contain"	0
Gwendoline is free spirited and lots of  beauiful skin adventure  and action.Good choice of entertainment.They need to bring back a lot of these typemovies with lots of skin and  G-rated action. Nudity mades these films very special..If you liked Sheena or Beast Master this is a good choice	1
"I was stunned by this movie. I learned of it and purchased it in 2003. For various reasons it remains for me the best, most emotional movie I have seen about musicians and their music. The producer chose well: He found the songwriters that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years: Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Guy Clark, Steve Young, John Hiatt, Charlie Daniels and a tribute to the late Skinny Dennis, immortalized in Guy Clark's ""LA Freeway."" I wish David Allen Coe had been left out, but no film is perfect. The songwriters are shown at their best and worst:  a drunken,  funny TVZ falls into a rabbit hole and Silent Night is rendered by fine musicians too drunk to remember the lyrics.  This movie was made when I was a poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends in Tampa at the University of South Florida. The difference is that most of my friends and I got straight jobs [we still tried to make a difference] but these musicians changed the world, just a little. I married the singer/Business major I met at USF and divorced 30 years later. I still play guitar, write and record at home and dream of making it in music - but mostly I learn songs written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand the magic they have that still captures me. When TVZ sang 'Waiting around to die' he brought tears to the eyes of his 70+ blacksmith neighbor, while Cindy comforts him. It was magical. TVZ does a ""medley of my hit"" and sings ""Pancho and Lefty,"" and Rodney Crowell sang ""Bluebird Wine,"" both covered by Emmylou. Steve Young's ""Alabama Highways"" was wonderful too. It was a look into my past -  and the past and future of the intelligent, emotional music I love best."	1
"Great casting, but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film.  It's so aggravating.  I want to chew my own leg off half way into it.  I know part of it is everyone is a ""talker"" of a various sort.  They're all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell.  I just don't think it works.  Otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived.  The best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves.  It gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name.  Mamet's an extraordinary genius-writer, but this did not belong on the screen."	0
"I own both the ultimate Editon and the Extreme DVD. I want to say that you can play the Theatrical version on your T.V with the Two-Disc Extreme Special Edition, on your menu on disc it should say play special Edition, hit right four times and ""the future is not set"" should be highlighted, push enter and you should see ""play theatrical version on your menu.

"The real life base (Dr. Li Ching-Yun, 1677-1933) adds to the wonder and mystery. Many movies usually pale compared to the book; however this movie fits all the criteria of a great classic. Such as excellent film footage for the time, even though some scenes are missing. When I look at the Shangri-La setting some times my mind wanders and I wonder if this was the idea behind the valley in the book ""Atlas Shrugged"" by Ayn Rand? I doubt that they could have picked any better actors for the parts. These actors fit the time and surroundings and were actually believable in the characters they played. A later remake of this movie was o.k. But just did not have the presence of these actors. Now the DVD features: Digitally remastered Audio & Anamorphic Video Production Notes Restoration Before and After Comparison Three Deleted Scenes Photo Documentary with narration by Historian Kendall Miller Many more By the way I personally enjoy watching and re-watching this movie."	1
This movie is by far one of the greatest movies ever made. You will laugh all the way thru it..and enjoy when things were so much simplier in Hollywood	1
This disk collects the two Tales From the Crypt movies on one side of a single disk.  For some reason the menu has the second movie listed first.In the first movie, Billy Zane is excellent as a demon looking for a final key so that the demons can retake the universe.  This is the story of his battle with the current Demon Knight, the protector of the key.  Wonderfully crafted and dark.The second movie, Bordello of Blood, is a more tongue-in-cheek T&A-fest and lacks the dark seriousness of the first.  Lilith, the queen of all vampires, has been awakened.  She can be controlled by a key (the one from the first movie).  She has set up a bordello to lure victims to her hunger.  Dennis Miller is his wise-cracking self as he portrays a down-and-out private investigator looking for a missing person.It is nice not to have to flip the disk over or insert a new disk but there is no room for real extras (we do get the original trailers).  Seeing the two films together really showcases the extreme difference between the two.  The first is dark, well-written and well-acted.  The second is gratuitous, crass and just not quite as good (although it is fun in its own way).  Now they are together at a reasonable price.	1
What a great cast!  I mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie, right?  After it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it, although you are shaking your head in disbelief!  Stunning!  You've never seen anything quite like it!  If you are a fan of the campy awful, you may see it as a masterpiece, if not you will still have a unique viewing experience.Proceed at your own risk!  Borrow or rent it before plunking down your hard earned cash to buy it.Did I mention the great cast?  So many of my favorites...even Goodman can't save this clunker	0
"Another tired story about the Blackman as the horrible villian and the Blackwoman as the innocent victim...And we wonder why our community has so many problems..Maybe it's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films...""Color Purple"" , ""For Colored Girls...."" etc. We need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we ""work together""...That means Blackmen and Blackwomen.."	0
"You can tell your life is REALLY pathetic when ghosts have to show you how to live.But that is what happens to Cosmo Topper, in the charming ""Topper"" and its equally charming sequel ""Topper Returns.""  It's basically your typical screwball comedy (complete with Cary Grant), but with an injection of supernatural pranking and murder mystery. In other words, it's loads of fun.George and Marion Kirby (Cary Grant, Constance Bennett) love fun, partying until clubs kick them out, and generally not taking life seriously. So it's a shock to them when they die in a car accident, and linger on as ghosts. Apparently they have not done any good deeds to go to the Great Beyond.So when George's boss, Cosmo Topper (Roland Young), crashes his new car in the same spot, the Kirbys take him under their wing. Poor Cosmo is stodgy and timid, with a domineering wife who schedules his day down to the minute. So it's up to the Kirbys to show the poor man how to live life and have fun, but their good deed rapidly gets away from them...And most sequels stink, but goofy murder mystery ""Topper Returns"" is just as funny as the first movie. Instead of a ghostly screwball, this time it's a spoof of ""haunted house"" stories, with a nod to Hitchcock's ""Rebecca.""Ann Carrington (Carole Landis) is returning to her ancestral home and inheritance, with cheeky pal Gail (Joan Blondell) in tow. But after the girls switch bedrooms, someone murders Gail. Confused, she drifts over to the house of Cosmo Topper (Roland Young), whose car she hijacked earlier in the day.Gail blackmails Topper into helping her discover who murdered her, and who is trying to kill Ann. Now the unfortunate Topper must somehow solve the mystery, despite a small army of creepy servants, a house full of secret passages and vicious seals, and his upset wife searching high and low for him...Based on Thorne Smith's novels, ""Topper"" and ""Topper Returns"" even had a spinoff TV series, which was nowhere near as good as the movies. And those movies are charming and still fresh, especially if you like to see a twist on the usual ghost stories.But it's the little touches that make this movie hilarious; for example, there's George laughing on a chandelier, and Gail chugging champagne when she discovers her own dead body. Not to mention that vicious seal. The comedy becomes more obvious and spoofy in the second film, but no less entertaining. But at the same time, these movies are graced by tender moments between George and Marion, and a truly exquisite scene where Gail's ghost wanders out the window into the sky. And I'm still not sure how that invisible-person-under-the-covers shot was done, especially with the primitive special effects of the 1940s. Roland Young is the star of the piece -- his Topper is timid, halting, and has his day scheduled down to the minute. Not a single spark of sponteneity. Grant comes across like a trickster god, and has wonderful chemistry with Bennett. And Blondell is simply charming as a resourcefully cheeky ghost girl.""Topper"" and ""Topper Returns"" are decades old, but are perfect examples of Hollywood classics. Charming, chipper and hilarious"	1
"Ok, check it out, there's two Jack Blacks. One is the guy from Tenacious D, you see him all the time. He's funny and childish and insane. Then there's the other Jack Black. He's the evil creature who pervades films like Shallow Hal and King Kong, whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by accident. Well, as long as you aren't fat and don't feel patronized by Gweneth presuming to know what it's like not to be desired all her life (ha), then by all means suspend all disbelief, logic, and brain power and watch this dumb movie. Gweneth's fat suit is actually pretty convincing, although most of the movie she's played by an actual fat chick...who by the way should have just been left in, without the whole ""ha ha the dude thinks she's skinny"" nonsense. Obviously, a film about a dude trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more resonance if:a) He weren't brainwashedb) His fat girlfriend wasn't replaced by a twiggy blond chick c) The movie didn't throw ridiculous concepts your way (like a guy could have sex with a 300 lb woman without realizing it)d) Tony Robbins was in no way involved whatsoeverI knew I was slumming it when I saw this movie.  But I'm not sure what the message of this film is.  Jack Black's character is decent, considerate, great with kids and perfect in every way.  Oh, except he's really shallow for no dicernable reason, other than his dad's dying words were for him to go out and chase tail.  The weird part is that Hal's not a bad person.  The movie beats you over the head showing you he's the nicest guy on on the face of the Earth, so you can't really laugh at him looking like an idiot.  Rosemary is so fat she has superpowers.  Her butt actually creates typhoons (I wonder if that has military applications?).  Suddenly, Hal mistakes ugly pimply girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews.  Tony Robbins brainwashed him, the fiend! When Hal finally realizes this he decides to (ooh big spoiler) love Rosemary anyway, and learns a VALUBLE LESSON.  Along the way there are a ton of cliches like people thinking he's dating Rosemary just because her dad happens to be his boss, and a sexy neighbor in his building who starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non-judgemental he is dating a fat girl ('cause that would make any woman melt).  Of course there's requisite best friend, played by Jason Alexander, who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get Hal to dump her.  Then again, the friend is a complete troll, so I don't know why Hal would want him around.  And to insult us further, they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a SERIOUS note about how true beauty is on the inside. Too...many...public...service...messages! PICK...ONE..!! But brain-dead writing aside, Paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her in the fat suit (despite Gweneth's postering when this film was first released). Regardless of its clumsy benevolence, I have to rate this as a romantic comedy. And for that, I give it a rating of totally unremarkable. Nice gesture, Farelly brothers. Not to be bothered with"	0
This is a fine, leveled workout, including stretching, aerobics, abdominal exercises and strength training moves (without weights). Gilad takes you through it with plenty of advance cues and tips to help you change moves smoothly, and position yourself properly for optimum muscle and cardiac work. The 30 minute workout is just right for an early-morning, before work routine. The 60 minute version is an extended workout good for weekends. Much better than most of these videos, this is particularly well suited to middle aged fitness buffs. 	1
"All ""style"" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The ""Entertainer"" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over. "	0
After doing this film Steve Martin quit doing movies for a while and even turned down scripts written for him so if your a huge fan you may enjoy it, but Roxanne, LA Story, and Bowfinger are some of Steve's best works. 	0
With the all star lineup this movie had, I would've thought that they could be better utilized than a story on the Gov. of Lousiana. This could have been a really good gangster flick - all the people were avaialable. Sean Penn instead of all his hand waving and droning on and on about something I really could not follow, could have put his skills onto something better. This movie is a complete waste of talent, money - you name it	0
This 1971 offering stars Giancarlo Giannini in a fine performance as a police inspector on the hunt for a psycho who stuns his attractive victime with a poison-dipped needle before eviscerating them.  The production is above average slick and the performances are fine, especially from Giannini, but I just didn't find it involving, suspenseful or stylish enough to keep my finger off fast forward.  It's not bad, just average.  The climax and the killer's unmasking is particularly weak and anti-climactic.Fans of the genre seem to really like this one, but I suggest a rental before a purchase	0
A review by the students in ENT 201, Insects on Film (Clemson University, Clemson, SC) Spring 2005When better to meet your new man than while saving the world from GIANT radioactive grasshoppers! That's what happened to Audrey Ames in Beginning of the End. The black and white movie, produced in 1957, takes place in a small Illinois town called Ludlow, near the big city of Chicago. The main character, Audrey, is a persistent reporter who discovers a new and interesting story on her way to write about a lackluster flying demonstration.  On her way to the flying demo, she is stopped at a roadblock in the town of Ludlow, Illinois.  It seems that the town has been mysteriously destroyed overnight! Following a lead, Audrey goes to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and meets with the project director named Dr. Ed Wainwright in order to find out more about what happened. Dr. Wainwright tells Audrey about a wheat factory that was demolished in the same area before the destruction of Ludlow. Ed, Audrey and Ed's co-worker, Frank, go to investigate the abandoned grain bins. While they are there, a locust comes from the woods and eats Ed's co-worker. They finally realize what is destroying the towns and eating the people-although it's a little too late for poor Frank Johnson.Determined to resolve the problem, the military enlists the help of Dr. Wainwright, who tries to find a sound frequency that mimics the sound grasshoppers make before they attack. The viewer of this film will be held in utter suspense, until, at a climatic moment, Dr. Wainwright discovers the right frequency and saves the city of Chicago from the military's impending drop of an atom bomb.  The sound is broadcast from a boat in a lake outside of Chicago and the sound attracts the grasshoppers to the lake. As the grasshoppers follow the luring sound, they eventually end up in the lake where they meet a watery death.  The city of Chicago is safe and everyone lives happily ever after (except, sadly, those who were eaten alive by the radioactive grasshoppers).While this movie has extremely entertaining moments, such as when the grasshoppers scale the skyscrapers of Chicago looking for food-the movie, in general, is a B attempt at science fiction. Also, the movie was produced during the 1950s, resulting in minimal attempts at realistic special effects. The special effects are entertaining at best and add humor more than substance to the movie.  The viewer also might be left with several questions after watching this movie-like why can't the National Guard protect the citizens from grasshoppers? Or, why is it more funny than tragic when Dr. Wainwright's deaf/mute assistance gets eaten alive by a grasshopper?On a scientific or scholarly level, the movie has several errors. The most important error, in the entomological sense, is the noise that the grasshoppers make throughout the movie. To make the noise that they did in the movie, they would need wings. In the movie though, the characters say that the grasshoppers could not fly because they didn't have wings.  Also, the scientist indicates that the giant vegetables were produced through radioactivity, which allows for photosynthesis to occur both day and night.  For photosynthesis to occur, light must be present, thus raising the question of how the vegetables could continue to expand during the darkness of night.  The inability of the grasshoppers to burn in the fires set by the military reflects an error as well.  In reality, grasshoppers are highly flammable because of their wax-like coating.  Finally, the plot as a whole is completely unrealistic and so bizarre that the movie should be placed in the comedy (opposed to science fiction) genre. While Clemson University research may have led to the evacuation of mole crickets from golf course greens, using technological concepts similar to those presented in the movie, the likelihood that radioactive grasshoppers would eat hundreds of people is improbable.Beginning of the End is an amusing movie to watch! The acting is traditional of the sci-fi movies of the era. The special effects are mediocre, but the humor, in retrospect, is delightful. If you are a fan of cheesy sci-fi suspense movies, give this flick a try! You will not be disappointed.  Who knows-maybe you'll learn something that could save the world the next time we are attacked by radioactive BUGS	0

"This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all.The plot is really about their burgeoning relationship, while his mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed Harold more socially acceptable. First, she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates. To foil any hope of romance with these women, however, he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother. She then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother Victor, a hawkish officer and Vietnam War amputee, to try to convince Harold to join the Army. The episodic structure of the story by Collin Higgins (years before becoming a director in his own right with ""Foul Play"" and ""Nine to Five"") allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters' actions. The movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements, surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone.Ruth Gordon is her typically pixilated self, an archetype she played for years afterward, while Bud Cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism. It's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later. There are funny sideline performances by Vivian Pickles as Harold's eye-rolling mother, Ellen Geer as an overly actressy blind date named Sunshine, and Eric Christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens' soundtrack hasn't aged as well as, say, Simon and Garfunkel's music in ""The Graduate"", but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings. Unfortunately, the 2000 DVD contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included"	1
Eric Stoltz give's a kick ass performance here!!How 80's is this movie??..VERY.. which is why it rule's!!Gotta love Elias Kotes as a skinhead punk!! he look's a bit like Henry Rollins back in the day!!I like the storyline a lot as well...thing is though I dont know why he decided to go for his more friend of a girl as oppossed to Tomlin's charachter..maybe because he knew her better!This a real good view into the 80's!!SEE IT TODAY!!!	1

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters are unlikeable except for Charity's two friends. The songs are far too long and I had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull. I was especially disappointed with Big Spender because I love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from Bob Fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar. The only redeeming factor was that Sammy Davis Jr. was in it. He's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid. This was my first Shirley MacLaine film and on the back it said that Sweet Charity was her best movie. I have no desire to see her other movies then	0
"How did he have the time to write such a picture, to co-direct it, to act in it and after everything else to write its score?  Noel Coward's energies, always remarkable, were redoubled during the second World War, and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism, which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing.  IN WHICH WE SERVE is still worth watching, but it's nowhere as appealing as either CAVALCADE or THIS HAPPY BREED, and its focus on the ""life and death of a ship"" (the HMS Torrin) is strangely monomaniacal, almost constructivist.  Over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away, symbols of brute strength like something from a Soviet film.  The ship goes up.  The ship goes down.  A new ship rises out of the water.  And in between Coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat, till our interest settles on three--Bernard Miles as Hardy, with his striking, long, hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it--he should have played Ichabod Crane--John Mills as Blake, a tiny little pipsqueak who's feisty in the standard Mickey Rooney-Jimmy Cagney manner, and Noel Coward himself as Captain Kinross, tranquil with class privilege and, in the background, his glamorous marriage to the ineffable Celia Johnson (so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums).Hitchcok's LIFEBOAT had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical, but without Coward's complicated flashback structure.  Coward stalwarts Joyce Carey and Kay Walsh show up as the love interests for Miles and Mills respectively--Carey, in this movie and in BRIEF ENCOUNTER as well, treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth, nor good-looking in any way, who's given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest.  She must have kissed the ground every time Noel Coward walked on it.  Who else would have written such roles for her?The movie is trying indeed when it goes ""serious,"" and yet that's half the fun of it, seeing how often Coward plays the ""race"" card--""we are an island race"" indeed.  I teared up, of course I did, during the Blitz as the V-1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on London households, leading to the death of several favorite characters, and again when Coward leads his naval boys into Dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half-nude British soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of Kool-Aid.  Outside of these scenes, however, the movie is marred by its agitprop and by David Lean's tiresomeness, in showing everything at such a glacial pace.  PS, the film was shot by Ronald Neame who later became a director himself and whose ""masterpiece,"" THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of IN WHICH WE SERVE"	1
A great ending to a great series, it left me craving more. Not olnly were the final revelations creatively developed the action itself was beautiful. Plus Mugen and Jin's final(for the time being) battle was great, leaving you starstruck and impressed by his ability to develope their relationship through battle.  It was perfectly constructed to make you want to beg them to make another season or at least a movie	1

"There are plenty of anti-Bush films and books around. If you only shall see or read one, this must be the best pick. I like Michael Moore very much, but he is not really a political heavyweighter. And i don't think Fahrenheit 9/11 is his best work, it does not mix humour and political insight as well as   the book ""stupid white men"" for instance. It is more like two or three movies in one. William Karel IS a political heavyweighter and he does not try to make anything more than a documentary. But what a documentary it has turned out to be. Very disturbing insights from informed sources, among them former CIA-agents. It is not usual to hear such plain speaking from ""people in high places"" just a few years after the events. This film is perhaps not as entertaining as Fahrenheit 9/11, but far more informative."	1
I am from Australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to Amazon. Is a complete season of Baywatch really Baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly, the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing? I don't think so.Not only have the distributors done fans no favours but Amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast. On the Amazon website as part of advertising for Season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it. If you go by the cast that Amazon have put on, you would think that it WAS the real original Season 1, when we know it is not.The release in the UK, which is out now and the upcoming release in Australia on March 14th is the real deal. Season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct. There are NO episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact. Might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal.AARO	0
They just don't have movies like this anymore.  This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen.  This is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past.  Charlie Sheen stars as a man who volutarily goes to war.  This seems odd and he figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was telling them this later in the movie.  He finds out alright.  Keith David plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role.  He cheers him up in a great scene where they get extremely baked.  The supporting cast in this movie is unbelievable and no flat performances here.  Overall this is my favorite movie of all time.  It has stood the test of time and never fails when I want to see a good movie.  I just have the old special edition, not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice.  It has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one from the military advisor who worked on the film.  There is also a lengthy doumentary about the making of and when I saw this I was mroe than glad I got the special edition.  You would nto believe what the actors went through!  It is a great making of. 	1
"I'm going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviews on this movie. I have seen plenty of Russian films, and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component. Mikhalkov, for example, is a director who can do this. This movie suffers from pretentious screenwriting, and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson. although the acting isn't necessarily bad, you don't get attached to the characters. I got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors didn't match the movie's theme and plot. At times it got so boring that i wanted to stop watching, even though i never do that. Anyway, I do not recommend this movie. IF you want to watch some good russian movies, go with ""Brother"", ""Burnt By The Sun"", ""Prisoner of THe Mountains"", ""War"", or ""Unfinished Piece for the Mechanical Piano"	0
"The Quiet Earth is overrated for a variety of reasons that will be discussed below. This movie is not the epic, thought-provoking, intelligent sci fi I was led to believe it was. It's actually very overrated, and fans of intelligent sci fi such as 2001 or Primer will likely be very disappointed. The first 30 minutes or so are jaw-dropping. I was really getting geared up for what I was sure was going to become one of my all-time favorites. The scenes of Bruno standing above the wrecked passenger jet, driving around a mall, the sun rising to the haunting score--all unforgettable. The scenes where Bruno starts to lose it, running around in a slip brandishing a shotgun, setting up cardboard figures of celebrities and pretending he's their ruler, giving them speeches (That's why I deserve to be President...of the quiet earth...I've been condemned to live) are all great. After this point the movie starts to disintegrate, and quickly. The female character is highly irritating, so much so that I think I would have ditched her and looked for other survivors. Api is also highly irritating, and when the film veers away from its central mystery and starts devolving into yet another film about a petty love triangle--my thumbs were pointing down, way down. Something needs to be said about the ending of this film. So many people have said that it's ""deep."" How is it ""deep?"" How is it deep when it's just a gimmicky way to quickly wrap a rather dodgy film that really doesn't have anything to say? Let's examine this. Many people argue the following (and if they were correct the film would've been much better than it was): The main character is a scientist who convinces himself that Project Flashlight resulted in ""the effect"" (even though others here insist on calling it ""the event"") which made everyone else disappear. The main characters come to believe that ""the effect"" didn't snatch them up too because they were died right when it happened. But what if there isn't any ""effect"" at all? What if these are just three people who died and then went to another earth where there aren't any people? The scientist then convinces himself that ""the effect"" is going to happen again, and, understandably fed up with the fact that the only other two people on earth are a bonkers, daffy, annoying woman and a nutty, homicidal maniac, decides to basically kill himself while blowing up the satellite for Project Flashlight. He dies again and ends up on another world, one which this time doesn't even resemble earth. The end. It would have been very clever if this was what was going on, if there really wasn't an ""effect"" at all and if the three protagonists had just happened to go to the same place when they died. Unfortunately, all the critics saying ""they went to another earth where everyone else was gone"" are forgetting something: the dead bodies! I know there aren't a lot, but remember, there's the radiation burn guy in the science station, and there's the dead guy on the hood of his car, and the dead woman holding a CB radio, etc. If they went to another earth where life was absent, why are there dead people? The real answer is that this movie was not very well thought out, that it doesn't make sense, and that the ending is just a cheap and easy way to try and appear impressive. According to the people who worked on the film, ""the effect"" obviously did occur, and what happens at the end is that when the scientist tries to kill himself a second time he dies, again, at the exact moment that ""the effect"" occurs a second time. So at the end, ""the effect"" does occur a second time, which means the girl and Api are history, and the scientist, as he again dies when ""the effect"" occurs, moves on one more time. Another point that is made in the DVD commentary is that the film was made by a Catholic, so the obvious purgatory then heaven tripe comes to mind.  Also highly irritating is that for a scientist, the main character is not very smart. He laments that he's the last person on earth and then he runs into a nutty woman. They find a nutty guy named Api and then the three of them conclude they're the last three people on earth! What?! Are they totally daft? A scientist would quickly reason that if there were three people within such a small region of the same city then there are probably other people in the city, more people than that throughout the rest of New Zealand, and even more people in bigger places such as America, Europe, and Asia. That his first conclusion is always that ""they're the only ones"" only demonstrates his stupidity. They come to believe that they all died at the same time, right when ""the effect"" occurred, and that that's why they remained on earth. Well, if three people died at the exact same time in the same city in tiny New Zealand, then many, many other people must've died at that time throughout the rest of the massive world."	0
With the flip of a coin , it's home I go. Ichi returns to the town he was raised as a child only to find that much has changed since he last left. A good film in the series I gave it five stars because I am bias and think that they all deserve five. This one was a strong introduction into Ichi's personal life along with the background of villians and lost ruffians with little or no way to reedeem their karma. Of course the cane sword is revealed yet again which leads to some good gore. I thought this was an all around good story with lots of underlying plays on greed and deception, and above all ,love ,shame and guilt from Ichi whom never seems to want to be bothered after it all goes down. Much is lost to our friend Ichi and he seems to just lose more.  	1
The only reason I gave this DVD set 2 stars, instead of the 5 that I would rate the show itself, is because there are absolutely NO extras on this DVD set.  No featurettes, no cast interviews, not even any episode commentaries.  While I appreciate the studios putting the season sets out in such a timely manner, I'd prefer they take a little longer and give us some fun extras to go along with the wonderful episodes	0
  Daniel Deronda is George Eliot's 1876 novel dealing with therise of Zionism incarnated in young Daniel Deronda. Sadly but truly this is the first major English novel giving a positive view of the Jewish people.  Deronda is raised by the wealthy Sir Malinger as an Englishgentleman. In the course of the long novel and miniseries he learns he is a Jew; meets his mother and is the love object oftwo fascinating women.Mirah Lapidoth is the Jewish musician who is rescued from suicide by Daniel. Her love for Daniel burgeons as she comes toknow and love the kind young man.Gwendolyn Harleth played by the brilliant acting of RomolaGarai is the spoiled,impecunious husband hunter who weds therich cad Grandcourt only to rue her unwise choice of mates!She loves Deronda as her marriage becomes a torture chamber ofpsychological combat.   Like all BBC productions this one is photographed in beautifully rich colors. The scenery is beautiful and the musical score is haunting to the ear.   This tale runs about four hours and is a joy.Many Americanviewers may be dismayed at the slow, leisurely pace of Britishproductions. Please remember that these productions are basedon long English novels which were published in several monthlyparts. They are long but they are also wonderful explorations ofthe human soul. Gwendolyn's story is a bildungsroman in which shegrows as a person. Ditto for Deronda who learns to take pride inhis Hebrew heritage.  This is a worthy BBC production well worth the viewer's time and money	1
For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie	0
I actually enjoy it more than the matrix.  Check it out, i liked it, so will you	1
The economy, austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound, and precise filmmakers... Lang, a master of the German expressionist film, shot his first talkie, a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies... It was a shocking idea for its time, based on the real-life killer Peter Kurten, headlined as the Vampire of Dsseldorf...'M' is about a terrorized city, and a plump little man with wide eyes (often chewing candy) who is a pathological child-killer, unable to control his urge for killing... The film embodies several Lang themes: the duality between justice and revenge, mob hysteria, the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in, and, for probably the first time in the cinema, it adds a new dimension to suspense: pity... For the killer is clearly mentally sick... He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease, and yet, we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal, rather than treated as a sick man... Early in the film, the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from 'In the Hall of the Mountain King'. This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace... And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window, the melody on the sound-track told us chillingly that the murderer is there, just out of sight...The Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since 'Casablanca,' 'The Maltese Falcon,' and 'The Mask of Dimitrios.' When the photographs of his victims, all little girls, are shown to him, he jumps back and twitches with horror...With powerful visuals, Lang's motion picture is Lorre's first film... His performance as the corpulent, hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion... Lorre is the archetypal outsider-outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes, outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal... He had only twelve lines of dialog...In the most famous of all about a pathological killer - Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre, but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy... 'Psycho' reeked with blood and horror, whereas the suspense of 'M' is subtle... A child's balloon without an owner, a rolling ball, are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed... The audience, trapped in its seats, torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer, watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight... 	1
Much of the plot has been outlined above, as well as the cast and I am, in large part, in complete agreement with the positive reveiws recorded.I want to add that, for anyone raised on the old Universal horror pictures, or the films directed by James Whale or Val Lewton, where the suspense is the important part of the film; this picture, Shadows and Fog, has this quality absolutely dripping from every frame! Despite the comedic elements (and there are many funny things happening) the tension rises perceptibly throughout the narrative. The climax is dissapointing for many, but if you follow the subtext of this extremely philosophical script it is nearly a perfect resolution in all ways.I have had philosophy students who were struggling with concepts of 19th and 20th century writers watch this movie and instantly gain insight into the point of the often times obtuse & oblique writings of Hegel, Kant and the like. I beleive that the unpopularity of the this film is based on people thinking that they were about to see Bananas or Sleeper.Love him or hate him, you have to admit, Woody Allen is DEEP. A personal favorite film of mine, but definetly not everybodies cup of philosophicallly comedic tea	1
"Whenever I think of the Second World War, the two places I usually think about in terms of carnage is the Eastern Front; and the war between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The other is the Pacific Campaign between the USA and Japan. One of the reviewers wrote, ""I'm glad the Russian Won."" So am I. And what a bloody war it was. The number of casualties and amount of destruction make what occurred in the others parts of the globe [except Asia] seem pale in comparison. The Russians suffered greatly at the hands of the Germans, and the German army paid one hell of a steep price.Also, it was in the east where the Germans committed some of the most horrendous atrocities known to mankind. It was in the east where extermination camps were set up to murder millions of Jews: The German  program of the 'Final Solution.' Everything I have ever read about the  Second World War concerning the eastern front is one of brutality on a scope that is horrifically mind-boggling. It's as if life were cheap and each day may have been the last. This documentary does a very decent job in attempting to address the fighting between these two armies. From Barbarossa to Berlin, it is one of the best documenatries out there. At least for the 200 minutes that the film devotes to the eastern front. I don't believe this is the definitive documentary, as more and more information is being released now that the Soviet Union is no more. But for now, I highly recommend this film. [Stars: 4.5]    "	1
I don't understand why there are so many low reviews here. This movie was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Also, it was very unique. I think that too many people are trying to project these actions in real life. This movie is FICTION. All the people who gave this movie a bad review should stop trying to see what's real about this movie and just sit back and laugh. This movie was extremely funny!!	1
"This movie works if one of the following four descriptions applies to you.1.	You think Kevin Zegers is hot, you want to see anything he's in, and the swimming scene in Transamerica was the best thing to happen to you since you first had a peanut butter sandwich.2.	You think Nick Carter is hot, and want to see if he can act. (He can't.)3.	You like horror movies, no matter how bad they are, simply because it's a horror movie.4.	For some reason unbeknownst to man you are interested in what Judge Reinhold is doing with his career.Within the first five minutes of the film I had it pegged as a Friday the 13th style movie. Within the first five minutes, it was. Then it expanded a bit, and we saw some interplay between father and son, and also some rather useless and pointless teenage romantic angst.In this rendition, the headless horseman actually had a head. It was a pumpkin. And it growled. There was also some serious fire that he was capable of - apparently - in the beginning. This fire was not with him when he needed it the most. And, of course, he used a sword to decapitate victimsLucky, then, that Kevin Zegers' character was on the fencing team (odd for such a small town to have a fencing team, don't you think?), and when he was able to get his hand on a sword at the very end - well - you get the picture.Judge Reinhold was a riot in the 80s. In this movie he was a football coach who talked about how things were when he played ball. I can't imagine a universe in which Reinhold played the kind of football he was talking to his players about. He would have died during his first game. He did, though, walk around the house with a football jersey on, and some silly pajama pants, so I guess that fit the role of a football coach. Still.All-in-all, I was certain that this review would be a one star review. Then it came out of the ""Jason woods"", and became marginally better.I was interested in the film for two reasons. First, I'm still waiting to see if Kevin Zegers can act. I have a feeling that he's going to break out of the horror mold he's in and become a lesser Jamie Lee Curtis. Unfortunately, in Transamerica they had him play a petulant teenager. They didn't give him room - i.e., they didn't write anything for him - that would have allowed him to express any range. Either that or he doesn't have any. Second, I do like horror films, even bad ones. Which this was. Just because I enjoy bad horror films doesn't make it a good movie. Which this wasn't.I was just about to post this review, then saw the three, four, and five star reviews. I'm sorry - what were you guys smoking when you watched this? Are you kidding me? As a bad horror film, this succeeds. But bad horror films don't get three, four, or five star reviews. It's insane."	0
Style : Salsa exerciseLevel : Very fitThis is now the best latin exercise dvd on the market. It is a Salsa style exercise dvd. It contains pure NY shines with some salsa rhythm inspired dance steps. It is a much better routine than her first dvd which was geared towards the beginner market. This dvd is made more for the serious Salsa dancer who is already fit.For people looking for a salsa shine video this would be a great start.I must point out you would have to be fit to do this dvd. It is very fast paced.Buy Lisa's first dvd to prepare yourself for this dvd	1
"The casting for this production could scarcely be better (of particular note is the harrowing performance of Judi Dench) and it's one of Shakespeare's best plays. That said, this film of a production on stage doesn't quite carry the viewer's interest for the entire play. There are times when the actors seem downright pretentious; you feel as if they're tellings us, ""We know how deep this is so appreciate it, please."" That's too bad since ""Macbeth"" is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film. Sadly, this relatively slow-moving production isn't it. There are, of course, wonderful moments with Mackellan and particularly Dench (no one plays the scene where Lady Macbeth goes crazy better than Dame Judi). I just don't know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase. For my money, Kurosawa's ""Throne of Blood"" is a far better choice."	0
"     This movie was so horrible I don't know where to start. Maybe I could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street. Or maybe he just casted his own family...at any rate they were untrained and stale. Secondly, I had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles. If Tyler Perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays, why wouldn't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit...If you're trying to actually sale to a christian audience. Furthermore, I thought the bible said a little something against divorce; like it wasn't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery/fornication. This movie seems to say it's okay to go against the word of God if you're in love. In fact, christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice....by even the protagonist! I laugh as I think of the scene where Ce-Ce Peniston's character says seductively, ""I'm looking for a man with his mind on Jesus"" Yet she's dressed like a hooker. Speaking of clothing, why did Ce-Ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene. They go on a date and she's dressed one way, by the time they come home she has on something different; with no logical explanation. And please explain why they had someone's grandfather playing the role of Rico Suave. Maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman's dream. I felt more like telling him about AARP than I did falling in love with him. In addition, the soundtrack, IT-WAS-JUST-ANNOYING. At some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music. I just wanted the maddness to stop! Lastly, It seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate (although some are) However, having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just, well, almost juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large. Overall, this movie made me want to puke. PASTOR Larry ""Flash"" Jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity"	0
"I previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars. But after watching it again, I realized I liked it better (I do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you). I do not consider all of the performances goth. Martiya Possesion are more tribal than anything(at least on this video) and I really dislike the expression, or lack thereof, on their faces while they are dancing. They either look completely bored, pissed off, or smug. I skip right over it. I also did not care for Asharah's dance to the drum solo by Solace (""Opaque""). The dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all. The music is saying ""fast, big, upbeat"" and she's standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves.And of course, we all love the S&M piece...excuse me, S&M is NOT part of the Goth subculture, and has no place on a bellydance video. Jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer, but she didn't dance much on this and I didn't want to see what WAS on her part.Another thing I would have liked to see is more GOTH music. I like Solace and all, but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the Goth genre. There were a few, but not enough for my liking.My favorites on this video were Tempest, Ariellah, Jeniviva and Ayshe (for wierdness factor). For all of its faults, this is a good video to be inspired by and I will use it for that purpose"	1
This is simply one of the best detective story ever made and Jerry Goldsmith's sound track ( which I also own) is probaby the best sound track. It was his favorite. Jack , Faye & John are at their best	1
I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.  Concerned in Alabam	0
OK, so most of the reviews I read for this film said how great it was, well I for one think those opinions are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing Angelina's breasts.  The acting was poor, the script was stupid, and the sets were lame.  I have seen some pretty bad movies in my time (ie Killer Kondom) but this one took the cake.. I would watch tromavision flicks over this one ANY day.  save your money. If you want to see a good sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for more than a week ;	0
"this a ""mystery-triller"" starring tom berenger,gretta scacchi,corbin bernsen,joanne whalley-kilmer and bob hoskins,it's the story of a couple who for some reason plunge off a cliff and survive.she falls out of the car early but he is trapped in and falls drastically,crashing all the way.she maintains a black and blue and a bruised arm,while he amazingly lives,at first leaving him in a coma,but more importantly leaving his face looking like hamburger.he eventually comes out of his coma to find that he has amnesia.later,after being nursed back to health and ""falling in love with his wife all over again,"" he finds a roll of film of his wife having sex with another man.obviously this makes him question what really happened before the crash and he hires a private investigator to help him find the truth.it sounds good and starts off as a pretty good thriller,but comes predictable fast.i knew the key 'mysteries' almost immediately and i'm sure that those who have seen hundreds of movies and law & order episodes will agree.eventhough it is predictable and the movie goes downhill at a certain point it does have some moments.i liked bob hoskins and his role especially but have no reason to ever see this again"	0
A terrific documentary.  Even if you have seen it on PBS, you need the dvd to view the great extra material	1
This one of those movies that I can watch over and over again.  The story is great, acting is good, and seeing the jerks get it in the end is the best.   The force of nature is just amazing to me and given the opportunity I would love to go on a Tornado hunt.  The special effects in the movie are very well done and realistic and the ending is perfect for this movie.  I would of given this one 5 stars but it has to be one heck of a movie for 5 stars.  The loss of a star is for some of the actors average job at there parts.  Rent it, buy it, watch it!  It is well worth your time and money.	1
While I thought the series was getting a bit old by the 3rd movie, this is still a very good price for getting 3 decent movies.  All have their funny moments.  I still enjoy the first the best.  Mainly because the jokes were original and fresh.  Though it is still funny to see the strange things Jim would get himself into.  Levy as his father was a great choice.  This is worth the 20 dollars easy.  Lots of laughs, and plenty of gross out humor	1
Wonderful.  I forgot how many great songs they have	1
"""The Petrified Forest"" is a filmed version of the 1935 Broadway smash.  The play starred Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart and their stage performances were preserved when Warner Brothers bought the play to the screen in late 1935.  The addition of  Bette Davis made good box office sense as she was beginning to hit her stride and was reteamed with Howard after their earlier matching in ""Of Human Bondage"".The film is set in the Arizona desert. A killer on the run holds up in a road house taking hostage a group of people there.  The play has a few things to say about ""the meaning of life"" with the juxtaposition of outcast wanderer and intellectual Alan Squier played by Leslie Howard and vicious gangster Duke Mantee played by Humphrey Bogart. The morality is fairly corny now and most of it is contained in the dialogue of Leslie Howard but he delivers it superbly so it still has some resonance. The film was a breakthrough for Bogart but his performance is too theatrical for my liking. Davis is a revelation acting with a simplicity and freshness which is almost unique in her career.  She is also very well photographed by Sol Polito and her big eyes glow. The DVD print is excellent and a lot of extras are included, including an expert and very detailed commentary about the film, a terrible Vitaphone short with the absurd Toby Wing and a funny cartoon about the Cocoanut Grove.  The radio performance included is almost unintelligible with a very poor Tyrone Power in Howard's role.The DVD is excellent value especially if it is purchased as part of the Warners Gangster Collection.

This is one of the worst films ever made! And I mean it!! One of the worst scripts I have ever come across. The acting is hammy and the direction is very weak! There was no reason for this movie to exist! &quot;Turbulence&quot; was a good movie and they should of stopped at that but two sequels! No way! If you like the 1st mabye try &quot;Turbulence 2: Fear of Flying&quot; but stay away of the 3rd. This is one terrible movie! Believe ME!	0
This has to be the best of the Alien films! This film, although not as scary as the original (I mean that it did not scare me as much as Alien), it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first. Also, this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series. Go on, buy the Collector's Edition of the first and this and enjoy	1
"One of my guilty pleasures is to review science fiction movies over and over again...Maybe I'm hoping the movie will get better with time. Unfortunately ""Judge Dredd""  does not! I'm a science fiction fan that can be suckered by mediocre CGI , an action hero star, a comic relief, and a beautiful love interest but please don't mess with the storyline. Maybe thiis is the case for ""Future Shock"" and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person's humanity and  ""Dredd"" forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary....In fact , I feel two stars is gviing this movie too much!"	0
"The reviewer who called this a Disney ""bait & switch"" hit the nail right on the head! I, too, remember seeing all these episodes on TV as a kid, then later on Disney Channel, and was awaiting these to be released on DVD, as I have already purchased the Davy Crockett and Tomorrowland sets and loved them both; but imagine my overt disappointment when I read the actual details of this slapped together, third rate offering!I never cared for the Elfego Baca story, I had been known to go to my room and VOLUNTARILY do my homework on Sunday nights when these episodes played, but I would have GLADLY paid the price for this set if it had included ALL of the ""Swamp Fox"" episodes!Above and beyond the fact that I am proud to have Francis Marion as a distant relative, and that I hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the Revolutionary War, who, with his compatriots, probably contributed as much as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, or any of the other Founding Fathers to win us our freedom, I really loved this story just for itself!Not only have I decided NOT to waste my money on this incomplete set, I have even gone as far as removing it from my ""Wish List"" to save the funds of my family and friends, as well! I shall wait to see, hopefully, if Disney will ever release the entire ""Swamp Fox"" story in a complete set, for which I would GLADLY pay their somewhat exorbitant price"	0

Daniel Day-Lewis must be the most versatile film actor in the world. He looks like a different person in almost every film he makes. I assume that's the real Day-Lewis in this flick about the rebellion in Northern Ireland, revenge and absolution. His romantic interest, Emily Watson, puts in a good performance too. Day-Lewis looks a lot different than he did in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, &quot;My Left Foot&quot; and &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; but he is just as compelling in his performance. I thought this movie degraded a bit at the end with its somewhat Hollywood finale, but otherwise I enjoyed it. If you like substantial filmmaking, good acting, great drama, unfamiliar vistas and a good story, you'll enjoy it too	1
Children of the Corn II~ Terence Knox is a movie that starts out well and then implodes into utter garbage. The special effects are much worst then the first movie and this is like 9 years later which in itself makes it even worst. The acting is so bad that one starts to liken it a parody and then one realizes that this is a serious production. The gore factor has been like pushed to a rediculous level and the storyline starts out well and then implodes into utter nonesense and the dialogue is so poorly written that one wonders if they went to Holly Upstairs acting school to write such junk. And to imagine that there are more sequells after this abomination is just beyond me.	0
FIVE STARS for the movie ONE STAR for this DVD because it is MISSING THE KEY SCENE when Clara talks to her parents in their bedroom after Marty drops her off. The DVD cuts from Clara putting her key in the door to Marty walking to the bus stop. Why the scene is cut I haven't a clue	0
The first time I put this workout DVD on, I expected to see exercises designed for abs, buns and thighs.  What I actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing DVD.  I kept going, thinking it would get to the abs, buns and thighs, but it never did!  The other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up, or headshots only, so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine, you can't even learn it, because you cannot see the instructors legs or feet.  Also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming, picking up on a different beat to where it left off.  All in all an awful purchase and not even worth the $4.86 paid.  I turned it off halfway through the second workout and put Billy Blanks TaeBo on instead.  MUCH BETTER!!! 	0
The performance given by Poitier will not dissappoint. This movie version of the play is done from the view point of the son as oppossed to the view point of the mother, Lena. This work is timeless	1
"This dvd does not claim to contain a debate about the origins of Christianity; it discusses an alternate viewpoint (as Dan Brown reminds us ""the winners write the history books"")This dvd is a nice antidote to all the oppressive ideas we have been raised with; esp. the idea of God as male, and the idea of women being unworthy of church leadership. This dvd includes interviews with Dan Burstein, Henry Lincoln, Martin Lunn, Lynn Picknett, Clive Prince, Dr. Karen Ralls, Dr. James Robinson, and Margaret Starbird. I particularly liked Margaret Starbird's interviews - she describes how when she first read ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"", she found it blasphemous because she had been raised a loyal Catholic. But afterward, she had religious experiences regarding the content of that book which lead her to research Mary Magdalene and write ""The Woman with the Alabaster Jar"". She comes across as very rational, sensible and even heroic. It takes courage to contradict the dearly held beliefs of the majority. I thought Dan Burstein also made some very good points with his discussions about the lives and customs of Jewish people during the time Jesus lived. I think this dvd is an important reminder that just because you have been taught something all your life - that doesn't mean it is necessarily the truth. To be truly alive is to continue to search for the truth as long as you live"	1
This one was really boring.  Only buy this if you are trying to collect all the Scooby DVDs or if you have a very young child.  Very young children might find this mildly entertaining.  This is not a movie for older kids/teenagers/adults who are fans of Scooby Doo.  I loved Scooby Doo: Zombie Island, Witch's Ghost, Alien Invaders, Cyberchase, and Legend of the Vampire.  If you want to get a good Scooby Doo DVD get those instead.  Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico was a huge disappointment too, but this was actually even worse. 	0
Clarification:  After reviewing the set and then receiving the set...I Must applaud A&amp;E for the brilliant 20 minute BEHIND-THE-SCENES special on the 5th disc!  Finally...the puppeteers get to talk about their work and you actually get to see inside the puppet's heads!  Also on DISC 5, they did include the lost footage from the 40th Episode!  BRAVO	1
This was part of the Marvel Action Hour along with Iron Man. At first, the animation and dialogue was pretty bad and they had annoying supporting characters, but the series remain true to the comics. The story lines they took from the comics were done very well, like episodes involving the Silver Surfer	1
"I was one of those that never got a chance to sit down during the live broadcast to watch Live 8 and certainly regretted that. However, I was fortunate enough to find this copy at Amazon and it's been everything I had expected and more. I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan and their performance alone was worth the price of the box set not to mention all of the other fantastic performances. I would highly recommend this box set to any music fan from any generation--truly a ""must have"" for anyone's collection! "	1
" The military courtroom drama,""A Few Good Men"" is one of those films, that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it's own. But even with countless viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases, that supposably he's ""never even seen the inside of a courtroom"". He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay military base they performed a ""Code Red"" (an illegal form of discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago, which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two accused Marines admit they did the ""Code Red"", both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command. With both time running out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as ""code, honor & discipline"". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter what? Whats' more important our ethics & principles (on which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col. Jessup right? Can we not ""handle the truth""? It's hard to believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post 9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance, that comes from Jack  Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous ""You Can't Handle the Truth"" speech. Even though the speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated & parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend ""A Few Good Men"""	1
The recent disappearance of Spalding Gray has made me realize what I don't like about this film: its narcissism.  It's Gray's defining characteristic.  After a while, despite Jonathan Demme's fabulous direction (he makes the  best of a limited repertoire) it just gets boring	0
I bought this because Raquel Welch was in it. She did a good job but it's not worth it. I loss interest as sonn as I heard the guy talking about the people in the movie. This DVD was dated back to the 1920s and How a movie star struggles to get his life back	0
This very B grade horror film left alot to be desired.  Aside from one blasemophous scene where the demon priest sucks on a crusifix to suggest oral sex, and a young man who has ripped open his shirt to carees his pecks sucks his crusifix, there wasnt much to make this unrated.  If your expecting to see frontal or rear nudity, forget it!  The nearest thing is teenage guys running around in tight calvin Klein undies. However, if your someone who likes to use your imagination, this might be for you.  One good thing about this flick is a pre Charmed hottie Drew Fuller rubbing himself all over in his undies.  If your a big Drew fan like me, it might be worth buying, utherwise go buy a playgirl	0
My husband and I are both history and literature buffs, so we were excited to watch this film when it was released to DVD. We aren't typically hard people to please, but this film was one of the most boring movies that I've seen to date. It's not that I don't appreciate artistic, visually stimulating movies - that have a point. Perhaps, assuming we all knew the story already, the director wanted to impress us with over two hours of lingering shots on grass, water, trees...and more trees. Apart from the lack of any foreword momentum whatsoever (though I will grant the last 45 minutes or so were interesting and possibly worth the slogging required to arrive there), this movie represents revisionist history at its worst. Here we are presented with an idyllic, practically un-fallen and un-corrupted view of the Noble Savage juxtaposed against the muddy, disgusting, conniving white man. Perhaps the writer forgot some of the more violent sides of some Native American life like scalping, or the less-than-environmentally-friendly act of running whole herds of buffalo off cliffs. It's fair to say, as the Post-Colonial talk goes, that Native Americans have been marginalized and misrepresented over the years. But by shifting to the other extreme, don't we fall prey to the same false stereotyping - just going the opposite direction	0
this has to be the worst thing they could do.. if you really believe in the Lord DO NOT BUT THIS MOVIE... it is based on many lies first off noah didnt save lot and his wife from sodom and gomorrah abraham did. and it was at least 350 years after the flood that this happen and after the tower of babel. but they have noah in sodom and gomorrah and then moving on and building the ark after its destruction. they also show a pedlar in a boat coming up to the ark once  everything is flooded and they have Lot on a ship attacking noah for his ark.. it is a half truth and in my opinion a MOCKERY and i will never buy anything again that has the name hallmark on it. how dare they sell such a lie to peopl	0
How can people like this piece of trash?What a stinker!I think the dad died from boredom after listening to his two idiot sons.And all that endless talk about &quot;the Institute&quot; which looked like it was setup in someone's garage.I can understand why some bikers would find this flick motivational.It motivated me to turn off the t.v. and go for a ride.I really believe this movie was produced by Satan	0
If you like CSI: Miami this dvd will not dissapoint. It has great picture quality and sound I have also purchased the third and fourth seasons	1
This is an excellent story well told in script and action. However, it is quite different from the version I saw on a big theater screen. This DVD has speeded up the action  and the English translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue. I was very disapointed in this DVD version and would not recommend it to friends	0
"My daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school. It wasn't until years later that I saw it, and I was HORRIFIED!!! This was a movie aimed at children??? What does a children's movie need a sexy bunny for? The lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and ""strutting her stuff"" on the basketball court in a very provocative manner, until the male characters were panting, drooling, and clawing their way after her like a bunch of  sick, depraved perverts. This scene was highly innapropriate for children, and is NOT the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls. Not only that, the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities. This movie should be kept far, far away from children, and was truly deserving of zero stars"	0
Many have seen this movie on TV many times. For a B-movie it is great fun and interesting to watch. No extras on the DVD. I wish they did add something from behind the scenes, etc	0
I'm watching the film right now, and it is perhaps the most moronic and stupidly annoying film I've ever seen.  There's nothing amusing going on.  It's all fluff and show.  It is such garbage.  I find it offensively stupid	0
This film had a powerful effect on me. 95% of the people I know don't read books. I met a millionaire not long ago, who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life. Lady Di was reported never to have read anything --- except perhaps fashion mags. My children hardly read, and their husbands and wives certainly don't. My ex-wife never read anything. Her father thought Ulysses was a dirty book. I stopped watching television in 1980, and I own 10,000 books --- but not Fahrenheit 451, which I'd read about 45 years ago. This was long enough for me not to compare the film with Bradbury's text, but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear, and with a very solid punch to the plexus. The manner in which it is written, played and directed, added to its impact. This world of sleep-walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us. The style was strange, but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal. People live and work like automated morons. They can't think for themselves, and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied. They can't conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind: in fact, present them with an idea, or attempt to initiate a discussion, and they'll often become angry. Some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts. Ludicrous suggestions: remake it with mad Mel Gibson. Have infantile Spielberg direct it. Bulk it out with computerised SFX. These ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub-humans which the film targets, and many of them seem unable to understand their own language, let alone write it, or spell it. This is a memorable film, for those whose memories still function. Unlike the Captain of the firemen	1
This movie is great!  Very subtle humor but if you watch it you will be laughing out loud.  Love it	1
I actually didn't mind Kiss The Girls because of Morgan Freeman. He saved the day in that movie. Plus, I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up. Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor. Obsessed with serial killers, psychos and the like, just as I am? Then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of Along Came A Spider	1
This DVD teaches the history of Tai Chi, and the History of the 24 posture form and 48 posture form. It explains that these two Tai Chi forms were originally a martial art style, and that now they are usually done for health improvement. Then it shows the 24 posture form from the front, and the back, and with breathing instructions. Im not quite ready to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements, but when I am, this is a great guide. It then shows each of the 24 postures, and their original martial art applications, which helps you have a strong intent during the posture, and keeps your arms and legs in proper position. THEN, it teaches the 24 posture form, step by step, with very detailed instruction. This is a much more expanded version of this video by Master Liang than the original VHS. The DVD also shows the 48 posture form, which repeats several of the movements from the 24 posture form, and has other movements from other styles. It has absolutely helped me develop strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the 24 posture form about 4 days a week on average. It has also improved my confidence, and people keep saying I have a glow about me. I just feel healthier, and happier too. This DVD is easy to learn from quickly. The Chinese bamboo flute music is nice. Oh, actually, my FAVORITE part is at the end, it shows a 'slideshow' of photos of the master, doing each posture move-by-move, with great music. I like to do my form along to this section, because it is a bit slower than the actual form, and you can exactly match your movements to the master. Its like having a one-on-one class with him. I find that this mimicing of his postures has helped me to learn more quickly. I remember the form now, without having to 'THINK', so I can try to turn my attention inward. A great DVD	1
  This reveals a great deal about Vietnam and the 1960's.Should be prized by students of Kennedy, Johnson, and our military history in the nuclear age	1
I really enjoyed this DVD. The instructor is very charismatic, unlike most instructional videos. He really knows his stuff. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because I don't believe that any DVD or video can really train a person to play an instrument. It comes from personal experience, not formula	1
It is an excellent movie, very well directed and the acting is superb. It awakens the natural instincts of empathy, compassion and love, for children all over the world are the same, ir-respective of color or ethnicity	1
"This DVD was the first one released by Michael Buble, and I bought it in hopes of seeing some of his live performances.  There are segments of performances, but the editing and fast, wild cuts from one angle to the next to the next to the next really detract from the overall effect.  The performances get largely lost.  What remains is a LOT of footage of Michael and his original bandmembers drinking, clubbing, gambling, womanizing, and generally acting like rowdy frat boys.If you really want to be wowed and experience what a live Buble concert is like, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ""Caught in the Act"".  This DVD lives up to it's name as part of the PBS Great Performances series produced by David Foster.  ""Caught in the Act"" is slick, glossy, flashy, enormously fun and absolutely true to the real experience.  I've seen Buble perform live twice, and I can attest that ""Caught in the Act"" is just about as good as being there"	0
This film can be interpreted any number of ways: as a farce; a tragedy; or just plain Shakespearean comedy. Brenda Blethyn has, in the past, acted in each of these genres and she brings that experience into Saving Grace with exquisite skill	1
"I have been a long-time radiohead fan and, like many others, have been waiting patiently for a live DVD.  So I was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist.  It never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old!  I couldn't help being disappointed when I watched this DVD.  The constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch.  In fact, I only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust.  I know I would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime.  I've always that Radiohead was modern, progressive, and totally innovative.   I appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey... and it doesn't help that before every song, Thom mutters ""this is a new one."" "	0
"What a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time, The Re-Animator.  Continuing in his deluded quest to claim the Re-Animator series for his own, and to convince us that he can direct, producer Brian Yuzna has managed the opposite.  Beyond Re-Animator merely confirms what was evident about the Yuzna-directed Bride of Re-Animator, that Yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story.As with Dagon, Yuzna seems to have secured financing from Spanish sources for this film.  Unfortunately, the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly Spanish cast.  This is a story set in Massachusetts, for crying out loud -- why would the warden of the prison, the reporter coming to cover the story, the guards, and a good 90 per cent of the inmates all have Spanish accents?  It wouldn't be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act, but they can't.  Simon Andreu as Warden Brando and Elsa Pataky as love interest Laura Olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast, but their acting is so bad, and their ADR-afflicted lines so glaringly off, that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths.  Yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes (witness the gratuitous ""nurse nipple"" scene in this film, or Fabiana Udenio and Kathleen Kinmont in Bride of Re-Animator), and Pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests I can remember.But even Pataky and Andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery, seething mass of bad acting that is leading man Jason Barry.  Based on Yuzna's shoddy history with actors, one might be tempted to blame it on the director, but the fact is that in this film, Jason Barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment, basic elementary acting.  His every internal and external beat rings false, his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading, and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre.  Most high-school students do better than this.  Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West, seasoned pro that he is, gamely plays along, but the script puts West's character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit-inducing Pataky-Andreu axis that Combs is unable to save this film.On a strictly technical level, the cinematography looks good, the score is all right (though often too serious-minded for its own good), and the film doesn't look low-budget.  But when the ""story"" is such a mess and the actors so inept, no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film.  Yuzna really should stick with producing, because on the Stuart Gordon-directed Dagon, at least there were some good moments.  But Beyond Re-Animator is beyond salvaging, possibly the worst film sequel I've ever seen, and way up there in the list of worst films I've ever subjected myself to"	0
"Man did I want to like this movie.Hackman is the best and the possibility of finding a mid-70s Gem was really tantalizing, but...this film is really, really mediocre.First we have sub-plot city going on, bad mid life crisis stuff with Susan Clark and Hackman ""Trying to communicate"" about their failing relationship. It's tough on Hackmans character ""Harry"" see 'cause he used to be an NFL player and now he's reduced to being a private eye, she hates it, he does not want to give it up and everyone concerned gets a bad speech. Don't get me wrong, this is no ""MegaForce"", where the film is so bad it becomes campy and actually enjoyable.This is just...mediocre. Buy ""Harper"" with Paul Newman instead"	0

"So, why give Justice League the full 5 stars?  Because it appeals to every generation in my family.  I bought this for my 4 year old son who is enamored with superheros.  As we hung out together watching the shows, I was as engrossed in the story as my son.  Then I noticed that my wife was intrigued; and so were the grandparents!  The characters and plots are very well developed for a ""cartoon"", so it is more like watching a dramatic series.  Watching the series allows you to pick up on sub-plots too; like the attraction between Batman and WonderWoman - Jean Jone's struggle to find a place as the last of his people - and the entire groups struggle to work together as a cohesive team.  Another excellent buy to consider would be the Spiderman the New Animated Series"	1
"I give this movie an ""A"" for ""avoid.""  Definitely the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure to watch (and yes, I've seen ""Angel Eyes"" so I do have a valid point of reference).  Chevy plays a guy makin' bacon with Farrah Fawcett (yes, I did just vomit) while Jonathon Taylor ""Buy a Last Name"" Thomas plays the petulant little crapface son who is anti-Chevy from the start (let's face it, who isn't?) and makes his life a living hell.  The acting is atrocious, the characters are poorly developed and hideously predictable, Farrah's nose appears poised to melt off at a moment's notice, and that little brat from ""Home Improvement"" couldn't be more annoying.  There is only one moment that is midly amusing (when JTT names Chevy ""squatting dog"" as his Indian Guide name), but too bad I heard that punchline in a joke my dad told me in 1982.  This movie is so bad that when Chevy drives his SUV off a bridge while rushing home to fulfill a promise to JTT you actually find yourself praying he can't open the window to escape.  If you enjoy banging your head against a wall, eating glass shards, or applying a curling iron to your bare skin, this is the flick for you.  Otherwise it is pure, unadulterated waste that a coprophagic dog would even avoid.  Trust me, if you value your retinas, avoid, avoid, avoid"	0
"The Book from Alex Haley when I read it some 10 years ago changed my life and views of people with color, and everyone should read it, yes even conservatives, manditory.  however, this movie something just wasnt good.   to long?  the over all acting?  Spike, you make some great movies, Summer of Sam is one of your best, Do the Right Thing. Spike has a gift for cinematography, however Spike Lee Interview on ESPN? The interview said, interviewer: ""Kanye West said that Bush doesn't care about black people. Would you agree with that? Lee: ""Yes, I agree with that, BUT I'll go one step further and say that Bush doesn't care about people who don't have any money (whether they're black or white.) I guaranteed you that if this same disaster happened on Long Island or let's say The Hamptons, you would have had an entirley different response from FEMA and his administration."" But you should have seen how he said it, it was as if he was staring right into the camera with this smirk on his face. The dude is bold man, I'll give him that and I applaude him. Spike said either black, white, Mexican, or asian. But what he DIDN'T say was Italians!! That dude has been getting flack forever for his dis'n of Italians in his movies, they call him a racist all the time. HERE WAS HIS CHANCE to say something, and he blew it. just didn't happen to say Italians? NO So HE is a racist too. And so are the Africans in Africa, they never have liked white people either, so what about that Spike? Try going over their and applying for a job! And while I am at, the African Americans in even Baton Rouge don't want the blacks from N.O. coming up their! How come spike never said anything about that? Fkn whiners, so many the world over! give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on TV and let the world see it for the fools they are. And ignoramus white liberals eat it up as its gospel and he is telling Da Truth "	0
"I found the film, ""Malice"" to be a very intriguing and interesting murder mystery. Sure, there are a lot of twist's in the film, however, that is what I found to be very good about this film. Especially the way these twist's were done. There will be no spoilers in this review. The film begin's with murders occuring in a small college town. Andy Safian (Bill Pullman) is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these killings. All circumstantial. Moreover, he is having problems with his wife (Nicole Kidman). Something happens to her, and she blames Andy for this. [To tell you would give away the film]It seems as if one of Andy's old school friends is now a practicing surgeon (Alec Baldwin). Therefore she decides to leave him and sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief, and the Doctor (Balwin) in particular who caused this grief to her. But there is more to the story than meets the eye. There are several stories going on at once. First, you have a serial killer, secondly you have a distraught wife (Kidman) blaming her ex-husband and his Doctor friend for what has happened to her. But there is more to her than the viewer suspect's. I will leave this to you to discover. The film is better than the reviews warrant. It is a very suspenseful film full of twists. Recommended!  "	1
"Abraham Lincoln's law partner once wanted to read some maudlin poetry to Abe.  Once he was done, Lincoln said ""The people who like this sort of thing will find it the sort of thing they like.""Beaches is fine.  It is obviously a chick flick.  Bette Midler has some real opportunities to sing.  The acting is good.  The problem is that the plot is so predictable"	0
"-Not a great one here, entertaining for all the wrong reasons, mainly because the film is so bad, so often.-It is nice to see Christina Ricci in a movie again, as she's usually good even in a bad movie and doesn't do too bad here.-Wes Craven directs this one and I could tell right away it must have been do to a contract obligation (much like Edward Norton in ""The Italian Job""). I could tell this because very little effort seemed to be put into the script, both the story and lines of dialogue were very predictable and dumb. Also very little effort seemed to be put into the effects, as they were very lousy at times, especially when they finally showed the werewolf.-As I said before, quite predictable the story was, both Ricci and her brother get bitten by a werewolf after they try to save a girl who got into a car wreck. Then both try to figure out what's wrong with them, though the brother is much more active about it than Ricci. -It's also quite obvious who the main werewolf was, the film tries a bit of a swerve, but it doesn't really work. -Besides Ricci, the cast includes Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie 1&2), Portia De Rossi (Arrested Development), Joshua Jackson (Pacey on ""Dawson's Creek""), Scott Baio (don't ask me why) among others. All do pretty poor jobs, besides Ricci that is, the rest don't really seem to care, not that I blame them that is.-There is some humor throughout the film, but a lot of the film will get unintentional laughs from those who watch it.-The only reason to watch this is to make fun of it as the effort is not really there by mostly anybody on the cast or crew.

"Eddie and Rose are meant to be in Nicole Savoca's ""Dogfight.""This is a warm and wonderful movie; those of us who have seen it have an obligation to spread the word to as many others as we can.  It's sad that so few people have heard of or seen Dogfight. How a film that was so universally well liked by viewers and critics managed to completely slip under the radar of popular attention is a mystery to me. Many others have synopsized the story, so I wont be repetitive. I will say that this movie's genius is in its acting. River Phoenix and Lili Taylor have the chemistry of childhood friends, and it shows in scene after scene. River gives the most endearing performance of his career in this film as the affectedly coarse, absurdly young ""jarhead,"" Eddie, about to ship out to Vietnam. His coming of age is the narrative behind this movie, while Rose's idealism and grace throughout the humiliating ordeal of the ""dogfight"" make her character angelic. The poignancy of the closing scene, in which Eddie embraces Rose, in tears,  after having lost his three best friends during the Vietnam war will stay with you for a long time.  Dogfight is a unique and touching film. It harkens to a sensibility which is dissatisfied with much of the droll offered as ""romantic"" by Hollywood today."	1
Let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie.1. It is incredibly beautiful animation2. The music is amazing3. I happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv seriesThe Things I don't like about the movie:1. The characters are not developed at all2. You get the feeling your only skimming the surface, like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread3. It almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process.Ok you may have see that I gave this moive a 2 out of 5, well that is becuase of the story line and plot.The story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation. The movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end. I just kept thinking there has to be more. But there wasn't. The best way I could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just couldn't find its parents. This movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff. But if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please don't buy it rent it first. I'm not saying its a bad movie by any means, just a bit empty for me.Just one more thing the Escaflowne series is very very good don't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series	0
This complete waste of 90 minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone-star movie.  With cringingly awful acting, laughable special effects (the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment), appalling dubbed dialogue, cheesy music, inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere, The Grim Reaper is a total disaster. Don't waste your money on this turkey.	0
Colorado's San Juan Mountains from Durango to Silverton to Ouray is my favorite place to vacation in the USA.  So when I saw the preview of Durango Kids on another DVD, I decided to rent it on Netflix.  It is one of those movies where villains are cartoonish, and the kids, whilecute, outsmart all the stupid adults.  The first 30 minutes showed somenice locations in and around Durango, including the steam train (that'swhy I purchased a used copy) but then it goes into time travel to saveOuray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore,intended for young and undemanding children.  Don't bother unless youlove Durango as much as I do	0

"These are excellent performances for a very reasonable price.  The look of some of the videos as well as some of the film stock is ""dated"" but the performances easily shine through.  Not quite as well played, recorded or filmed as Bernstein's many later Unitel films but still well worth the investment.   I won't spend time on details but rest assured it's all great stuff!"	1
Phantom Quest Corp. an action/comedy film about the drunken, karoake singing,party girl Ayaka and her friends taking on paranormal enemies, from Dracula to a possessed surgeon, mummies, and even magical monks. This Movie is a comedic romp through the world of supernatural events.The only set backs on this flick can be that the theme songs can get a little annoying after hearing them too many times, the series is too short although it was still good. The video quality was also pretty nice, and subtitles were understandable and on que. The plot is sort of like scooby doo without the guys in masks, but more action and laughs. All in all this film is a great buy and worth the money spent. A great addition to any anime collection.	1
"This film harks back to a time when africentricity was woven into the psyche of the younger generation.  Blackness informed all of their life decisions and defined their aesthetic. This is definitely true of the younger generation in this film. Another dynamic at play in this film is a sort of intergenerational upheaval. Some members of the older generation were reconsidering their long held beleifs on what it meant to be Black in America while the rest of the older generation stood firm staunchly defending their fossilized ideals. So if you're in the mood to see a comedic family film with a post sixties revolutionary air view ""Five On the Black Hand Side"" and breathe in the culture"	1
A true love-it-or-hate-it movie: my reaction fits closer with the first group.  This gritty look at the dark side of the drug culture plays like an open wound. The parallel stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet pills, while her son tries to make a living dealing, although he, his partner, and his girlfriend smoke and snort a lot of the profits.  The director's jarring style fits the subject matter well, and Ellen Burstyn's performance as the diet pill addict is nothing short of amazing.  Julia Roberts beat her for Best Actress in 2000 with Erin Brockovich, which was a fine role and performance, but Burstyn was in another world.  Those who hate the film will complain about the style and whether the events at the end make any sense.  I can understand the second objection, hence four stars rather than five.Note: I got this movie from Netflix--I'm not sure if I was watching the director's cut or not	1
"This movie is all about entertaining.The combination between ""Die Hard"" and typical martial arts flick works in many levels, but the production values are Hong Kong`s, don`t miss that point.Fans of Jet Li are welcome, but action fans be careful. Here we can find scale helicopters burst in flames, exploding building models, chopped off dummies, you name it. The characters are extreme in their own context: Jet Li is a former military now becomed bodygard and stunt actor, loyal, gentleman, honorable, deadly, you know, a portrait of the typical good guy. The bad guys are also extremely violent and cool looking. He doesn't fight or kick much in this film, but he shoots a lot, dodging bullets from a dozen bad guys with machine guns with no scratch at all, his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading, he drives a car inside a hall and uses the elevator, that happens to be be the right size...Well, you have to be in the right mood to watch this film without laughing at the many cartoonish production mistakes. But if you are into Hong Kong low production values action films, you will really enjoy one of the best ones of the 90`s.By the way, this DVD edition sucks. English dubbed, subtitles, poor sound and no extras, not even a filmography"	1

The no-name comedians at the beginning were funny, Bea Arthur killed, and the dumpy lady at the end who kept talking about how African-Americans used to dig her backside but don't any longer was funny. Courtney Love's antics were amusing but grew tiresome. The rest of the roast was horrible. Telling Tommy Lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is not an insult. And, after it's repeated ad nauseum, it's not funny either.Has Andy Dick ever been funny? Kimmel? Corolla? Sarah Silverman? Spade post-Farley? No. It's as if Comedy Central corralled the most unfunny comedians of the past 10 years.And the bonus features are horrible. The interviewer was annoying--even the guests seemed annoyed with her.Was Gilbert Gottfried not available? That guy is funny	0
as someone said in an earlier review, the movie is split up into two parts.  the first part, training camp, was good. i enjoyed the movie up until it switches to vietnam.  after that, i found it unwatchable. the main character is so annoying, i kept hoping he would get shot instead of his supporting cast. if you're looking for a good war movie, look elsewhere.	0

I like this movie a lot - not just because it is made by Visconti (one of the greatest cinematic figures of the 20th century) or because of its cast (Dirk Bogarde and Helmut Griem are always good) - no, I think it is the way the film attempts to look at a bigger picture through the corruption that surrounds a wealthy family that makes this film so interesting.You can see elements of this style in other Visconti films like the Leopard, in Coppola's Godfather trilogy, and in Fassbinder's Maria Braun.  Now to speak of Visconti's visual genius - Has there ever been a director who could sustain a scene in such a virtuosic way as in the nazi 'party' scene midway through the film - Or again in 'Death in Venice' - with the scenes on the beach. Anyway enough of my babble - just see the films of Visconti - and you will see what I mean	1
This is one of the best animes I've ever seen what does it for me is the same people that drew Cowboy Bebop has now drawn Wolf's Rain. I love the music played in the series that's why they made a CD came along with also a stuff amimal wolf. I wish their was a second season cause I began to love the show	1
After seeing both Peyton Place and the sequel I can tell you that I could tolerate the recast, Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld were wonderful in their perspective parts.  But I have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well?  My reasons for asking, the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie.  Over and over in this film it is stated that Selena was raped when she was thirteen, yet in the original film Selena, Alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured.  Since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school, also she looked pretty mature for thirteen.  Then there's Selen'as boyfriend (whose name escapes me at the moment) in the original film he stood by her, through the murder charges, the revelation of the rape, and the miscarriage, yet in the sequel I'm suppose to buy that he couldn't handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else.  Then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town Doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of Selena, yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast?  I have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door. It was all too obvious that the original film wasn't taken into account when writing the sequel.  Not credible at all	0
P.D. James' mysteries rank as outstanding entertainment. This CD featuring Roy Marsden as Adam Dagliesch is excellent.  It has well developed characters, a complex plot involving actions that took place years before, and scenes in both London and on England's coast. I highly recommend this product	1
There aren't enough movies like this these days. Family oriented(centered actually), adventure with edutainmental attributes.Great cast, great score, great(albeit goofy) story.People give this film too much credit for being implausible, which is exactly what makes it so much fun to imagine the ramifications if it were true. If you're looking for adventure and fun, thrilling characters in a family film, this is it	1
If you liked Yul Brynner in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; you will love him in this movie. Brynner is cool as they come. This is a great western and should be on DVD	1
Finally, an ab video that makes sense and works.  This video is truly innovative and unique.  Imagine having rock hard abs and great core strength without doing a sit up or a crunch.  You have to see it to believe it!  Mike Griffith makes this video fun, easy to follow, and very challenging for the beginner or most conditioned athlete.  With a short amount of time and minimal equipment, this program will stretch and strenghten your abs in a functional way.  I am a physical therapist and I use these techniques for patients with back pain as well as for performance improvement for athletes.  I have been using it myself, and it works	1
I echo most of the previous reviews.This Hayley Mills vehicle has little to do with the excellent Mary Stewart novel that it shares some of its title with.  Hayley was too young to be the novel's heroine, and so for this film the plot and romance were 'youthened', sanitized (though the novel's romance was also chaste) and also very much dumbed down.  As a featherweight Hayley Mills film, this is harmless, and very much a lesser- Disney film of the 60s.  Just don't expect this to be more than it is and you might enjoy it, even with your kids of today, as a retro laugh	1

"In 1973, director Nicholas Roeg took a Daphne Du Maurier story about a strained family situation, added a child in a red coat and some superlative direction, cast wonderful, talented actors such as Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, and produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror, the unmissable ""Don't Look Now"".Six years later, Cronenberg - obviously, oh so obviously having been influenced by the starkly pared-down imagery and understated elegance of the Roeg picture - decided to put his own markedly different spin on a terribly similar theme, with disasterously boring results.To synopsise the plot: Frank Carveth's estranged wife is crazy, and undergoing unconventional therapy at her psychiatrist's controversial institute. Suspecting her of abusing their daughter, he removes her from his wife's care, to the strenuous objections of her shrink. Several people connected to wifey's emotionally crippling past begin to show up dead, and Carveth finds himself fighting to save his daughter from her crazy mother's 'other' set of kids.So it's David Cronenberg. So what?Performances and direction, as well as screenplay, are all simply mundane. There's barely a shred of the sleek, polished talent we have come to recognise as David Cronenberg, and what we have instead is a sort of mishmash of some of the better aspects from classic American horror movies, as seen through the obviously tired eyes of the writer/director. It's almost got the sense of isolation of 'The Shining', but there are too many incidental characters. It's almost got the same sense of murder-by-numbers as 'Hallowe'en', but lacks the decisive action of that movie. It's close to the stark imagery and sense of motherhood-gone-awry as 'Carrie' (and even the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to Piper Laurie!), but Samantha Eggar's performance is too overblown. Makeup effects, too, are over-ambitious for the time and fail to create any sense of impact or drama, in that they just look silly. Of course, you could say the same for 'The Exorcist', nowadays, but where that film still has the incredible strength of Ellen Burstyn's and Linda Blair's performances, all 'The Brood' has to go on is some deformed alien-figures that hiss a lot. It's not good.In short, where a movie matters most, 'The Brood' fails wholly to deliver, instead regaling us with 90 or so minutes of unfulfilling cinema.A note on the subtext: It's difficult to feel any sort of respect for the social commentary contained herein. Sure, topics like the state of the Nuclear Family and the negative effects of a Mother's love are riveting things, when handled properly. Unfortunately, when the package and presentation are so obviously hollow and overdone, who could care less about subtext?I couldn't."	0
"In the days of the Arcades there was a good movie that came out (and funny enough had a great Arcade game) called Krull. Now mind you, I really had no idea what this movie was all about before i saw it (when i was a whole bunch younger) just saw the 5 bladed ""glaive"" and was sold but now as an adult i find i still like this movie and it reminds me of a true dungeons and dragons style adventure then almost any other movie (including those terrible scifi D&D movies ugh) it starts off with a prince and of course a princess yes been done before many many times but then in come the Slayers and from then on its a totally different experience. with such ultimate favorites as the Emerald Seer, The Widow of the Web and the Cyclops and of course the shapeshifting (a bit daft too) wizard with some very strange habits (i dare not tell you so as not to ruin it) but this is a classic movie and it will be good for generations to come.Pros: cool effects (for the time) good story well done plot and themescons: may be a bit too old for some and not flashy enough. but remember it is a tad old.its a 5 star easily some may not agree but judge the movie on its merits and not against those of today and anyone can see the care and detail that made this movie great"	1
The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical	0

"As a character movie this is largely a failure, unless you find poignancy in ""average-ness."" The characters are all one-note half-stereotypes who seem to be sleeping their way through the non-existent plot. ""Oh, look how average they are! Isn't it charming how they sit around and talk about nothing? It's so lifelike!"" And the main character's seeming inability to be anything other than perfectly angelic at all times makes it awfully hard to sympathize with her.If this is intended to be an issue movie with the message Robert Ebert has suggested (that anti-abortion laws are really just a form of discrimination against poor women), it's taking a rather belabored approach just to tell us what anyone with a head on their shoulders already knows. Munich and Syriana also ""bring to light"" ideas that are not new or novel or shocking to anyone who cares to be informed and think about the world. Perhaps the only thing truly shocking is that movies like this would need to be made to say such obvious things. Perhaps next they'll make a movie to make the point that, shockingly enough, the sky is blue, or that paint dries when applied to walls, or that grass grows. I imagine they'd be somewhat more interesting than this effort"	0
The whole point of this ghost story, is like in the orinigal, a surprise, twisted ending. Yet, once again, in a 90's Hollywood horror flick, it is dissappointing. The actors within the movie are actually pointless and show no effect,but, there not to blame. The blame is the poor script writing for this movie. The movie has you going until about half way through, when they introduce the ghost to you. Now, unlike any other ghost in Hollywood history, this ghost is literally a black blob. It contains some invisible bodies and haunts people with its face, which in turn, reveals the face of whom it kills. But, literally, when you put a 100 foot ghost into a movie, you better make sure its in the right one. This movie should probably been called The Blob, not House on Haunted Hill. It is a horrible re-make and a waste of about 2 hours. Please, for your own sake, rent some good genre horror, like Halloween or When a Stranger Calls. Not some crappy remake that wants to make you leave the room your watching it in. Better luck next time to the director, producer, co- producer, and writer of this film, because of all the people that took part, probably just wanted to make some cheap money, so they made a movie. Better luck next time	0
This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him	0
This collection brings together five of the older British war stories and is excellent value for anyone who enjoys such movies	1
All the Danger man DVDs are excellent. The shows are extremely thought provoking and are much more enjoyable if viewed, giving time for some entertaining analysis that almost always occurs when I put these on. Any fan of Mcgoohan, British TV or TV with some intellectual bite to it will enjoy this series	1
Collateral Damage is the great and partially real action film in which  Arnold Schwarzenger plays a fireman hell bent on getting his hands on the Terrorist who killed his wife and kid and many other citizens near a shopping mall. With the attacks on Sept 11 , movies have tried to cash in but Collateral Damage is different. Arnold even dedicated the movie to firefighters everywhere in an interview  with Byron Allen. The movie is brilliant in showing what only what the motivation behind terrorist attacks , but the depiction of slow agencies like fbi to counter these terrorist attacks. Basically, the FBI and CIA tell Gorden Brewer(Arnold Schwarzennger) that they are working to bring down the terrorist who killed his family, when in fact they  have no good leads on the suspect. Rather, than sitting on his butt, and waiting for the FBI to do something, Gordon takes the law into his own hands and seeks to get justice for his family  by going into Columbia and getting ''The Wolf''(Cliff Curtis) as the terrorist is called. There is a great scene in which Gordon goes crazy and literally beats the hell out of a cold-blooded radio news reporter who says that the victims are pure garbage by saying their ''collateral damage''. The radio reporter explains the reasons behind terrorist attacks but shows no feeling for victims. I loved this scene, because this reporter clearly has no remorse for the dead. He probably has no family of his own, and doesn't know the meaning of life, except to cover his own. Now you might say to yourself what's the difference between Arnold's character (who is going for justice) and the terrorist well here is the big difference from  Arnold himself: ''The difference between me and you is that I am only going to kill you''. Unbelievable action and twists at the end, that you're literally be on the edge of youre seat, and just when you think the movie is over.... it's  not !!! Director Andrew Davis not only gives a fact type based movie based on Columbia, but also a factual based type movie that deals with Terrorism and the lessons that we must learn to see that things like this don't happen again. In fact, most people will remember the horrible case of Wall Street Reporter , Daniel Pearl, who was executed after the U.S. failed to meet the demands of the Middle East terrorist holding. The U.S. should have gone after these terrorists like the way Arnold does in this movie. but then the U.S. does not have a great track record when it comes to nailing terrorist even going back to the 1970's the U.S. supported and backed upmadmen like General Pinochet in Chile and dictator Samoza in Nicaragua. Both of them killed hundreds of people with U.S. backing and funding.Still though ''Collateral Damage'' is a great action film that you must see.	1
I bought this for the Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy documentaries, like I imagine you might. I'm not disappointed really, I don't regret buying it in any sense, it's just that this DVD isn't very good at all. It doesn't attempt to make any insight, which isn't something I particularly care for anyway. What each documentary offers is a limited and quite dated view of the serial killers. I can't imagine anyone learning something they didn't already know from them. It's mostly told through pictures when it seems there's option to use video. The Dahmer documentary, made in 1993, doesn't feature anything of interest. There's no interview with his father or anything, just a voice telling a story over pictures we've all seen before, with occassional clips of victims' families in court. The Gacy one, made in '96, is the same. There's also a program, made in 1997,on criminal profiling. This look at three farely well known killers whose capture supports profiling. It's told often with video rather then photos, which is good, but still they're somewhat boring subjects. The Criminal Profiler, Dahmer, and Gacy are all episodes from the A&amp;E series Investigative Reports, if you didn't realise. The last program is on Charles Manson. It's quite different from the others on the disc. Made in 1997, it originally aired on television as Biography: Charles Manson: Journey Into Evil. I don't with have any interest in Manson, but I guess it's ok. It features significant interviews with Manson and main female members of the Family. All programs run for about one hour or more. I wouldn't reccomend any of them, none are good at all. I might even describe them as terrible, considering what else is out there	0
When DVDs came out I thought that CDs were gone.  I thought all bands would start making videos out of all their songs and selling DVDs instead of CDs.  That's what happened with records.  CDs came out and no one released vinyl anymore.  I am so glad that The Sun was the first band to do this.  Every song on this disk is golden.  There ain't a bad song in the bunch.  I heard about this disk on NPR radio.  It seems that it was taking Warner Bros. so long to release the CD that the band made homemade videos for all their songs.  The record company heard about this, watched the videos and said, that's cool, here is some more money, go and make the videos professionally and we will release it as a DVD, like it was a new idea or something.  I talked with my buddies and most of them also thought this should have been done a long time ago.  Another thing that is way cool is the audio tracks.  All the songs are on the disk in .wav form too so that you can put it in your computer and tell Windows Media Player or whatever you use to put it on a regular CD and play it in your car or convert them into MP3s.  There is even a sticker on the shrink wrap encouraging you to convert the .wav files.I could go on and on about how much I love this disk.  I played it for my wife, kids, coworkers and they all loved it.  Like other reviewers said, The Sun is a new classic.  Keep it up boys.	1
"Truly frightening, gruesome, a gore-fest, a bloodbath, AND it has a plot... really, there are a lot of clich� expressions to describe this movie but they're all true: It's a HORROR movie in the true sense of the word.I hadn't seen a Rob Zombie movie before this one, but I would have to say, after seeing it, that it's got to be his masterpiece. I don't see how he could top it. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is NOT a movie that people who don't like the genre should be watching. I don't think they'd be able to stomach it. It's a downward spiral of evil, depredation, degradation and mayhem out of an imagination that must be really SICK (but awesome). The sense of humor in the movie actually doesn't spoil it, it just makes it better, it's so malicious. The atmosphere, the acting, the special effects and makeup, everything contributes to an hour-and-a-half long ride through a freak show that shouldn't be missed by true horror-movie buffs. Buy it, rent it, whatever. If you love being scared, you'll love this movie. It delivers!"	1
"How he makes money ""acting"" is amazing to me.  These Hollywood versions of a fake historic events make me cringe.  Especially when Hollywood exec's send their "" talent"" to making the rounds on talk shows to plug the painful"" blockbuster"" that's going to be a BIG FLOP and they know it but they think people are stupid (and most of us are) but Hollywood hates to lose money so they put a spin on it anyway, I'd laugh if it wern't so sad.  Anyway, Tom's army unit was choosen to update the Japanese army at the request of the puppet emperor , but really it's the emperor's councelor who makes all the decisions, so, the evil councelor decides to ""westernize"" his army the samuri swordsmen must be totally destroyed.  Tom accidently on purpose kills a samuri and feels bad so he tries to make it up to the wife and son then he realizes a brutal beauty to the life of a samuri and joins them.  It's very paint by the numbers story and acting, even the Japanese landscape is boring.  Of course the U.S. Army is painted as bad guys when the whole blame for the mess and bloodshed that follows can be put squarely on the shoulders of the weak emperor who didn't have the guts to put things right with the samuri in the first place. Then Tommy has some kind of ephifany and decides to stay in Japan. Snore. This movie was too long, and with all the money spent on this movie it really could have been a 1/2 decent semi-historic story about the destruction of the samuri in Japan"	0
The best Cleopatra that the movies has ever produced.Be it in the scenario as well as the performance of an actress in the part.So many came before and so many after Elizabeth Taylor however to me Cleopatra will always be Elizabeth Taylor.A mega movie, with fantastic costumes, and acting, is a classic in historic movies.If you are history lover you should have this movie in your collection	1
"I first saw this movie around 1980, when the Cold War was still on. I had been inundated with propaganda from birth, that all Russians talked about was political, that they didn't do ""normal"" things or live a normal life. All politics you know. Well, here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women. It was very well acted, and basically, just a long soap! I loved it--and not one word about Lenin, Marx, or anti-Americanisms. I recently saw it again, and liked it just as much. For those who say it is unrealistic--well, how do you know? Do you think that all Russians lived the exact same life? Or because American Cold War propaganda stated that all Russians were totally miserable"	1
"Hallmark Entertainment has made many movies from children's books, and this probably one of the worst.  Based on both ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"" this movie stars many of the familiar faces of Hallmark movies and children's movies, such as Gene Wilder, Miranda Richardson, Martin Short, and Whoopi Goldberg.  The lead character of Alice is unfortunately played by an actress that is not so good.  The movie revolves around her, and she seems to move from one scene to the next with little emotion or expression.  Even the crying scenes seemed fake.  Where is Dakota Fanning when you need her?  The cinematography, costume and set design are spot on, as usual for Hallmark movies, but the soundtrack was unnoticeable.  The only bright spot was the engaging song by Gene Wilder's character.  All in all, quite boring"	0
I just finished watching Callie and Son. I got my copy from the Dollar Store and it has another movie (Power Passion and Murder) with Michelle Pfeiffer in it as well... It really wasn't that bad, considering the price I paid. Lindsay Wagner is actually the main character and I think she did a great job, as did most of the actors in this film. The only trouble is the movie lasted about a hour longer than it needed to. With a bit of editing and a bit better script, it would have been a great movie! The end was somewhat unexpected and horrifying... I'd recommend it for someone to watch once, but I wouldn't pay more than I did for it. The DVD quality is really poor, the sound fades in and out, but for what it was, a bargain bin cheapy, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.	1
Based on a true story and a book called EVIDENCE OF LOVE, this tv movie is made remarkable by the Emmy-winning performance of Barbara Hershey.  She is utterly magnificent in the role of a middle class housewife who brutally murders her ex-lover's wife in a self defensive rage.  Hershey superbly captures the many nuances of this seemingly normal woman who commits a heinous deed.  Her hypnosis sequence is brutally painful and she pulls out no stops in showing us the hidden rage.Brian Dennehy is equally good as the lawyer who tries to get her out of her terrifying predicament.The movie is impressively done and once again worthy most of all for Ms. Hershey's dynamic presence	1
I first saw this movie when I was a kid.  It left a good impression.  I am now nearly 50 and a cat came to live with me.  My first female cat.  I named it Mewsette in honor of Judy Garland's character in the movie.  I then searched for the movie on the internet, found it, bought it.  While it's not as good as it was when I was a kid, it is still amusing	1
"This might be the perfect flick for a fourteen year-old who aspires to be a mass murderer. There is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property. Even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" films, his salute to the genre, or ""Reservoir Dogs,"" which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence.""Bullet ..."" is little more than two hours of broken glass, fire, blood squirts, amputation, beatings and explosions. This makes Gladiator look like a Sunday school picnic. The characters are totally flat, one-dimensional. There is virtually no plot aside from excuses generated to wreak havoc. The acting is weak, static, despite the fact that I don't understand a word of Cantonese. We are presented with a series of stereotypes (the hooker with a heart of gold, the good friend, the crazy friend and the bad friend).Unfortunately the American stereotype of the Viet Cong as madmen  -- and Saigon as hopelessly corrupt -- is reiterated here to the detriment of any understanding of Viet Nam during the American occupation. The worst thing is that -- because they are so shallow and undeveloped -- you don't care what happens to the characters. So I'll tell you and then you won't have to finish watching the film: they kill each other. My advice-- skip it"	0
Don't discount this film because you are dismayed by Tom Cruise. This film is excellent and a must see. The symbolism in this film alone makes it worth a look. Attempt to ignore good old Tom and rekindle your love for him pre-insanity. Kubrick rarely gets enough accolades for this movie, as he should	1
"Seinfeld-Season 6 would see the sitcom finally hit #1 in the Nielsen ratings. This was also the season where the storylines became more complicated as Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer would all be involved in one caper or another in the same episode. George's parents, Frank and Estelle Costanza, as well as Jerry's parents, Morty and Helen Seinfeld, and Newman are featured more prominently and we also see the debut of several strong role players such as Mr. Pitt, David Puddy, and Kenny Bania. Amazingly, the storylines stayed strong throughout the season as several episodes would become classics. And while Jerry was usually considered the weakest of the four main actors, his work improved a lot during this season. Disc 1 starts the season out strong with the excellent episodes ""The Big Salad"" and ""The Pledge Drive"" as well as the hysterical classic, ""The Couch."" ""The Chinese Woman"" and ""The Gymnast"" are also very good episodes, both showing the continuing neuroses of the Costanzas. The sitcom always seems to have great episodes on Disc 2 and this is no exception with ""The Soup"", ""The Switch"", where we finally learn Kramer's first name, and ""The Race"" all being classic episodes. Disc 3 is also top notch, featuring the excellent ""The Scofflaw"", ""The Kiss Hello"", and ""The Doorman"", also known as ""The Bro"", as well as the two-part ""Highlights of 100"" episode. Disc 4 starts out with the classic episode ""The Jimmy"", which earned Michael Richards an Emmy for Best Supporting Actor, the excellent ""The Fusili Jerry"", and the strong season finale, ""The Understudy"", which mirrors the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan fiasco, only with Bette Midler, of all people, playing the victim. As usual, the extras are just as strong as the episodes. The Running With the Egg featurette that shows how an episode of Seinfeld is created is probably the best feature thus far in the Seinfeld series. The bloopers are also very funny from this season, especially the ones from ""The Fusili Jerry"" episode. The deleted scenes, inside looks, exclusive stand-up material, and the Notes About Nothing are also top notch. Although not quite on the level of Season 4, which was their best season, Season 6 was another great season for Seinfeld as the writing was still top notch and the ensemble cast was running on all cylinders. Highly recommended.  "	1
"I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common.  I can't say I really liked either.  The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" taught me about ""roman a clefs"", of which ""Devil"" is one.  Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that ""Devil"" provides.  Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough.  Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) ""made over princess"" role.  The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as ""best friend"" Lily, are mostly wasted. "	0
"...that you simply HAVE to see, ""Mrs Miniver"" being one, a little known film dealing with a fictitious German invasion to a sweet English Village, ""Went the day well?"" and this film. Why so? Because all 3 were made at the start of the war (early 40's) when England stood very much alone in the fight agaisnt Hitler and aggresive facism. Invasion fears were rife, the war effort looked hopeless at times as in Europe, Hitler opposing country after country fell to the German aggressors (not to mention the rampage going on in Africa at the hands of Rommel  aided by the Italian forces under Mussolini's instruction).  England's small island identity stood alone and under threat and was bombed, starved and demoralised into feeling invasion could happen any day. It was quite possibly the darkest of times in English History and these three films capture the flavour of that dispondancy but equally the might of the will to survive and protect, with realistic perfection. In which we serve does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly, inspiring us to care about these folk from many walks of British life. For a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made (1942), and I guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear and hope which was precisely Coward's plan. An absolute gem and a must see, I weep every time I watch it"	1
"Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house) and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon commited suicide. Only four girls remain.The act which Cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum. Four of the Lisbon's neighbors, four young boys, suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got hold of Cecilia's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she thought she would fly.With their youngest sister gone, the remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding themselves further from the outside world. When school starts again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The usual profuse apology to the mention of the word ""death"" and the like.Trip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she's not interested. But after his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip's request, knowing nothing but Trip's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew.After Trip explains the situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke.They then drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow, but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence.The girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home. Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides.Ultimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to sum up the story in a few lines (such as ""Follow the lives of the Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation."") the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie, they should've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences. The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to, perhaps, people who like movies such as ""Elizabethtown"" which Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future"	0
I decided to buy a couple strawberry shortcake movies when my 3 year old daughter received a bunch of Strawberry shortcakes for her birthday.   These are very cute movies! They have a couple of cute songs, fun storylines and great messages. 	1
My HD-DVD also does not work on the 360 add on. I tried the press OK and everything else I could think of. This disk just freezes right after the production logo when it should be going to the menu. This is the only HD-DVD disk that I've had a problem with and I have about 10 of them. I didn't purchase the Chicago disk as I already have it and didn't think it was worth the HD purchase. I did purchase the Eagles HD-DVD and it is excellent. That one also has a trick to it. It defaults to a PCM stereo file so you have to triger it to the DTS ON mode and then it is amazing. I hope its true that microsoft is working on a patch for Heart. I saw them last year and they were fantastic. Not as good as the old days but neither am I. They still surprised me that they sounded sooo good.**** UPDATE**** Since Amazon doesn't have acceptible response.E-mail from distributor IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT received 2-13-07:Dear DaveThank you for you inquiry.

While the dubbing may be a little annoying, I still love this movie. The fight scenes are great and the movie is pretty funny at times. Driving motorcycles over cars will always be cool in my book. Don't expect the deepest movie in the world, but do expect a quality martial arts film	1
This movie has a lot of meaning behind it. The actors put on a really good show. Movie is lacking special effects but that does not hurt the quality in any way. Story keeps on unfolding in unexpected ways.	1
This is an excellent film, which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor.  I was very disapointed in the quality of the release- the picture quality is poor, inter-titles appear to be missing, and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that don't match the action on-screen.  It's a shame, because a film like this one deserves much better	0
"Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of ""Mississippi Burning"" or the anger and impunity of ""Ghosts of Mississippi"", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade ""Miss Congeniality"" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not ""a powerful film."" It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like ""Mississippis Burning,"" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies"	0
I found this to be a absurd movie. It just has alot of things in it that are just too far-fetched, and the plot itself wasn't a strong one at that. To me it just seemed that it was trying to be a slapstick pirate movie, and it just didn't work. It tried to be a movie that all the family could watch, and it didn't work. It tried to be a disaster movie, and it didn't work. It tried to be a drama, and again it didn't work. I got a few chuckles out of it, it held my interest for maybe the 45 minutes to an hour that I watched it, but it was just sloppy, and uneven, and the best thing was watching most of the pirates in drag at the beginning.	0
This exercise video was very easy to get started on and you could do all the exercises in very limited space.  This is great for people who do not have alot of room.  After exercising to the video, I felt really good, energized.  I would definitely recommend it to someone who is just starting out exercising. It is low impact and easy to follow	1
I became a Robson Green fan when I saw the first season of Wire in the Blood.  Since then, I have read the books, and watched Green in his other crime series, Touching Evil.  If you like to watch films about police solving serial killer crimes, you will enjoy this.  The crimes are shocking, the denouement is interesting, and at the heart of the story is the developing relationship between Dr. Tony Hill (Green) and the police woman with whom he works these crimes	1
Avoid this cheapo release of these great film! subpar prints..certainly NOT from original 35mm elements..wait for the good one to come out down the road	0
"I didn't give this five stars because it's some kind of Oscar-worthy achievement, but if you are a fan of the quirky, B-grade fantasy genre that had its heyday in the late seventies to late eighties, then this film is a must. ""Hawk"" offers hilarious jump-cut editing, dialogue that is spectacular in its badness, and probably the most memorable elf character ever put to film. For all that, the film is also remarkable for its innocence, in a time when cheesecake T&A fantasy like ""The Sword and the Sorceress"" and the infamous ""Deathstalker"" series were the norm, ""Hawk the Slayer"" keeps it clean, and is all the funnier for it.If you have the right sort of friends, then snap this gem up, invite them over for beer and pizza, and have a go. It's more than worth it"	1
This is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie. It conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere. Once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of TOMANDANDY helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since DON'T LOOK NOW back in '73. This was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out, alongside WHITE NOISE, as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of The success of THE SIXTH SENSE.	1
"This is the 2000 or so version of the DVD.  This is identical with the VHS version, except it adds two features.  The first is an excellent ""Making Of"" video from 1996 -- which was re-done with a different host for 2006, but all the ""interview"" segments are the same.  The second was a ""Making Of"" video done for the DVD, which doesn't add a whole lot.Were I to do it again, I'd buy this version, and skip the 2006 ""50th anniversary"" release.  This is the classic Chuck Jones television ""Grinch"", in one of the best packages for it.And the ""Horton Hears A Who"" is also a Chuck Jones classic.  ""A person's a person, no matter how small."""	1
I'm very very picky about my action movies and this one is worth the trouble.  Story line shmory line, this is an ACTION movie.  I watch my action movies for action not a lesson in philosophy and religion.  Kind of a heartbreaking movie, though, because he's dead no matter what.  The man can't sleep or he slips in a coma.  Going out with a bang with a freefall from a helicopter telling his woman how much he loved her... that's a film.  You won't regret owning this, I promise you.p.s.  It is very possible that the negative reviewers are crackbabies.  That is all	1
"The Dead Zone is still one of the best shows on tv, and while I agree with some of the other posts, the Stillson story arc was handled, well, strangely.As for the DVD's the box reads ""Closed Captioned"" as a feature. Sadly they are not. Hopefully USA knows about this, and will remedy the situation"	1
The ordering, speed of delivery were great, but there was one huge problem which ruined all the good points.  The wrong movie was delivered.  I ordered Honeymoon in Vegas and received Leaving Las Vegas.  And it was too late to return the movie and receive the replacement in time for Christmas.  So that was bad	0
"This thoughtfully prepared collection of 3 Buster Keaton movies, 2 shorts from early and late in his pre-feature period, and the feature Seven Chances, show a wide range of comedy styles, from slapstick, to more refined visual humor, to what we would today call situation comedy, where laughs come from unusual or embarrassing encounters. The earliest in the collection, ""Neighbors"" from 1920 is in some way the most satisfying of the set, although Keaton had not yet here fully developed his mature style of humor. Here there is still a stylistic resemblance to the earlier association with Fatty Arbuckle. The backyard love affair, for example, that opens the film resembles Arbuckle's 1915 classic ""Fatty's Plucky Pup"". In Neighbors there is more story, revolving around the standard theme of feuding parents, and the eventual need for the couple to elope. There is sweetness, youthful energy, and innocence in the entire movie, as well as great acrobatics, including the innovative climactic escape involving two levels of men being carried on the shoulders of other men. The Balloonatic (1923), near the end of the period in which Buster was making short films, is less rich in comic ideas and lacks the energy and freshness of the earlier film. There is almost no slapstick but rather visual humor involving being trapped in a balloon and trying to survive in the wild and win an unwilling girl. Keaton loves using bodies of water and other objects of nature for comedic props, and this film is full of them. Still, for once Keaton seems uninspired, perhaps making this film to fulfill a contract requirement rather than for love of the story.The feature in the set, Seven Chances, from 1925, is based on a single theme: Buster, the rich boy down on his luck, must get married by the end of the day in order to inherit 7 million dollars. This absurd premise induces, for much of the film, a Hal Roach-like situation comedy rather than the visual, acrobatic style that is more associated with Keaton, as Buster is cornered into continuously proposing marriage to strangers. The variety of embarrassing rejections that Buster must endure has funny moments, but may not satisfy all of Buster's fans. The climax, however, returns us to tried and true Keaton formula: the lone man being chased by a thundering herd, in this case, of angry women in full wedding apparel, fed up at being duped by a newspaper ad submitted by Buster's colleague unbeknownst to Buster. The chase has satisfying moments, including Buster dodging large bolders. Although worth seeing, the reliance on the single absurd premise makes this film feel more like a dragged out short movie than a genuine feature. The result is a slightly less satisfying encounter with Keaton's genius."	1

"This movie is a disaster. There is not one single memorable performance by the cast of ""stars"". If you want to see a little boy happily running to school, get hit by a car, walk home injured and die, have at it.  There is a reason that this movie is deeply discounted by Amazon. Criterion is probably losing money on this release and they desire it. They should be is ashame"	0
"Hello, fellow ""Amazon'ers"" out there in cyber-land :)I grew up in the MI TV series era.  As a TV/DVD collector of primarily 60's-80's series and member of a couple of TV/DVD forums on the 'net, I can mention to all of the ""Amazon'ers"" out there that this is a gem that we've been wanting on DVD for years.  As for some of the ""Cruise"" posts, I saw the 1st MI film and, as others mentioned here, it's somewhat like comparing ""apples and oranges"".  From a TV/DVD collectors point of view, we want the (TV-series remake) films released, since in a lot of cases, the studios will release the original TV/DVD series as a market ""tie-in"" coinciding with the film release.  TV/DVD collectors may not purchase the film on DVD but in a lot of cases, the film ""gets the job done"" for the TV series release.  My favorite season of this series was S1.  I liked Steven Hill in the IMF Force Team Leader role just a little better than Peter Graves although I thought Graves did an outstanding job in the role after Hill left the series.  I also liked the original script line of  ""Please dispose of this recording in the usual manner"".  :)  What can we say about the ""Landau/Bain"" team on this show?  Classic!  And, what a casting jackpot for Greg Morris in the ""tech/electronics genius"" role :)This series is a must-buy for most of the TV/DVD collectors out there.  It's simply-put, a ""sure thing"" gem for your collection.  I only hope that additional seasons will make it to their release[s].  As the saying goes, ""It's all about the #'s"" (sales #'s).  Hopefully, this set will sell well on the 'net stores and your local outlets.""As always, should any of your DVD's dislodge from their hubs in transit, the Shipper will disavow any knowledge of their existance"". :)Signing off from Dallas, TX  ""This poster may self-destruct in 5 seconds"" :"	1

These are not the original theatrical realeases. In addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films, American Cinematographer noted in their review of the DVD release that they had gone so far as to change the color-timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels. Though they are an impressive technical achievement, I'll be buying the academy award winning films that I saw when I was younger	0
What a horrific movie to gear towards children.  It is extremely violent and just plain creepy!  The scene where the dog is hanging from a chain and drowning in water was so WRONG.  I wish I could put 0 stars for this one.  Do not waste your money on this one	0
Spurlock decided to undertake an interesting experiment with his own health; eat nothing but McDonald's fast food for 30 days.  The result; his health gets ruined.While Spurlock's experience is not exactly a scientific study you could publish in the Lancet, it is a disturbing examination of what fast food and soft drink are doing to our health.I rarely eat McDonalds (though I enjoy the odd coke) however the restaurant chain is quite popular in Australia, as it is worldwide.  The strength of Mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer.  McDonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass production to fast food, and made Ray Kroc (its founder) a fortune.  I don't really buy the line that multinational corporations are evil, because they are multinational corporations; we have to remember corporations exist in relation to governments and ultimately consumers, as well as shareholders.  We happily buy coke, McDonalds, cigarettes, and many other things obviously bad for our health, and yet seem to like to blame the company which provides that addictive substance to us when our health goes bad.  In our individualistic culture, we tend to all too readily avoid self-responsibility and the virtue of self-control, and in my view this is part of the reason fast food exists.However, the rocketing levels of obesity, especially amoung children, are of great concern, and it is clear the marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food companies is at least unethical.  We need to make sure the tide of obesity turns in the negative direction, otherwise this generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents.  Spurlock's experience is a warning to all of us to take the warnings on eating well and exercising seriously, and not ignoring them for the sake of self-indulgence	1
Once again, Koch, for reasons that I cannot possibly fathom, assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog weren't being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes. I know I'm feeling large amounts of gratitude. It's gratitude when you want to disembowel someone, right?At least the copy I bought was used, so Koch didn't make a dime off of me. Anyway, this is another Koch release that you should definitely avoid	0
"David Lean's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" like Jean Renoir's ""Grand Illusion"" is an anti-heroic war film, set in a prisoner of war camp environment... But there, the point of resemblance came to an end... ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is an adventure film in which the nature of World War II is explored... And if in ""Grand Illusion"" the characters were described by a great artist who treasures their common humanity, in ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" they are forced to carry out their destinies by an officer who cannot bear to see his bridge blown up...Escape is almost impossible from the Japanese camp located near the Kwai River in Burma... The prisoners are badly treated by cruel guards... The camp commander is a rigid psychopath... Conditions are hard to bear... Psychological state of the war British prisoners in constant alteration...Into the presumptuous situation comes Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness in a fascinating performance), a strict, serene, dedicated British Officer, deeply concerned for the welfare of his men...Nicholson is under severe pressure from the stubborn Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) for insisting on his attachment to the Geneva convention and refusing to allow his officers to be used on the construction of the strategic bridge...Nichilson survives the oppressive punishment imposed on him, but his obsession has risen to near-madness... He agrees to help the Japanese build their bridge, and in his determination to find victory in defeat, he ignores that the bridge, which he insists must be a 'proper bridge,' will serve the Japanese objectives against the British troops...In addition to the powerful rules of a prison camp picture, captors against captives and an interesting moral respect to a military code, a third element, in the story, is introduced: a small commando team led by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) and an American sailor (William Holden) whose mission is to destroy the strategic bridge..The film leads swiftly to a suspenseful climax: a Japanese train and a Commando force directed to a same goal, the Brige of the River Kwai...Each character, in the motion picture, has a valid reason for what he is doing, and each elaborates a relationship to the bridge revealed to be obsession and insane...""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" hits with 'war' in a compelling logic of events, the indulgence of self-destruction.With a great visual beauty and terrific whistling tune March, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is a great dramatic entertainment of the wills of men...

"This movie is asome its one of my favorites from the 90's and probably my favorite plot twister/ who done it along with M night shamylans films. this movies great plot is over looked by the average americans craving desire of sex and scandal which is retarded and makes this country alittle less than great. anyway the shear sex appeal is also one of the tones that makes this movies atomasphere so great the music hits it perfect and the 2 leads are my favorite younger actress' neve campbell and Denise richards who are both perfect for they're rolls. The whole movie is just oozing with sex appeal that combined with the story makes it irresistable. which is unexpected from john Mcnaughton as it was his first big claim to fame film. bill murray adds some much needed comic releif and the plot will keep you guessing till the end and will fool anyone even those retards from CSI. The 2 girls have ""it"" in theyre rolls they just seem to fit together like a sexy peanut butter and jelly sandwhich. I was fist drawn to this film ever since i meet Matt Dillon at universal studios he was just asome and i had to see him act, and everyone recommended this movie for that and he was asome in it to. infact i wouldnt mind meeting the whole cast all of them are huge idols of mine and theyre all so cool. i do miss neve campbell.. i wish she'd come back to films and it looks like she will. so if your looking for a once in a lifetime plot and an asome cast this movie has it or if your like the 99.9% of people who have seen this and you only like it for the threesome and the pool scenes then i guess its good for that to since ive only seen the editied verison. Ps dont waste ur time with the other sequals theyre stupid and repeats of this one with not so famous casts. take a look at the fist still at the bottom it sums up the whole ""it"" thing i was taking about you just feel an incredible amount of ""cool"" form that shoot, well i did anyway"	1
Not very familiar with Noam Chomsky's work but I have listened to many people say that he has very strong arguments. This film is proof of those arguments. Noam Chomsky has facts, refers to original sources, provides context and analysis and leaves  you feeling that you have heard a very solid and well-research argument. This film is a collection of such arguments on issues and events affecting many of us in the world. America's invasion of Iraq, the war on terror and what is behind it other than 9-11, and other topics are rich and insightful. This film provides a nice balance on Chomsky by giving us some insight into HIM which is interesting. I find him more fascinating now than I did as a skeptic who was challenged to actually read his material. This film gives those new to Noam Chomsky's books an excellent overview of the issues and events that he has written about in the last five years or so. After watching this film I went out and read 9-11 and his latest book. While good, the film gives us the same information but in a more direct and candid manner.	1
"I saw this THAI horror film about 3 years ago. I have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made from Thailand, and I have seen a fair share of them(Nang nak, the sisters, mae nak, art of the devil series).The film focuses on Tun and his girlfriend Jane. Tun, a photographer reunites with his old friends. On the way home, they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on, Tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them.  Ok, I am not spoiling anything, the story is more complex than it sounds. Tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them, with Jane caught in the middle. As usual, there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people. ""Shutter"" refers to his camera and what it represents. ""Sometimes the dead cannot let go of their loved ones.."" I'm stopping here, I don't want to give out anymore.The plot is not that complex, but believe me when I say, the film is well-made. It does a great job of putting things together, each shocking scene is linked to the past and the present. I didn't see any scene wasted and it has that very atmospheric, creepy feel to it.  Also, there is a scene in the movie that Tun and Jane looked at ACTUAL photos of ghostly apparitions in a polaroid. Honestly, this film has some great scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end the very first time you watch it and the ""shock ending"" has the greatest twist of any horror flick I've seen! I've seen a lot of horror films, only THE EXORCIST and THE OMEN ever scared/creeped me out, and SHUTTER came very close. My female friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my place.Since I haven't seen the TARTAN release and I only own the region-3 DTS-ES rlease from PanMedia (Hong Kong)but Tartan usually uses the same transfers from either the HONG KONG or KOREAN versions. The video is sufficient, with some dark and bright contrast. It is not free of grain but it does add to the atmospheric feel. the DTS soundtrack is great though, very crisp and loud. The english subtitles are excellent, the Thai language track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen.A DEFINITE must-see if you are a fan of ASIAN HORROR or horror films in general. It rivals RINGU, ONE MISSED CALL and the original JU-ON 1 and 2.FOUR AND 1/2 STARS!"	1
"This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood.  I'm not sure when this ""score"" was ""written"", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film.  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film.  With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while.  If you want an affective, edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another edition. "	0
Granted, I saw this movie at about three in the morning at a party, but I think I had enough sense in me to realize how truly horrible it was. It's so... bad. It has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved, and the script was just awful. Gosh, it's hard to believe I actually sat through it. It was just so... exactly what it was, I guess. A stupid sex comedy that's absolutely terrified to be anything else. The thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material. I think my real downfall here was the fact that I'm a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys. The scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it's almost ridiculous. Now, I'm not one to get offended easily, but this just took it a bit too far. Just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed, which isn't really something I look for in a movie. It just seems to me that if 'gay' had been replaced with 'black', this would have been deemed racist and probably wouldn't ever have been released. Not that I'm condoning censorship, but when your tone becomes so... mocking, I guess. Oh well, I guess all I'm trying to say is I will definitely not be repeat viewing this film, and I don't recommend you view it at all if you're a woman, or gay, or you care about others	0
The great power of this movie is that you have no time to breath between the action scenes.The plot is easy to follow and all is the action and I think JJ abrams did a great job as director.This dvd is worth looking	1
"Okay, the rating above is not going to be liked but I have to be truthful.The only good thing going for this movie was the return of ""Snake Plissken"".This film's plot was essentially a rehash of the original ""Escape From New York""...A bit more special effects (which in fact, did not make this a better movie)... When I go to a sequel I expect to get what I paid for a totally new adventure with the same character / characters.Kurt Russell's character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them. Obviously the movie doesn't really know where it's going as it takes two scenes (15 minutes of the film) (1st scene - President, Commandant, and Lackey give Snake the mission) (2nd scene - Commandant and Lackey brief Snake before he leaves for the mission)  to explan to the audience what's the basic conflict.I guess either Carpenter or Russell are just getting too old to take a GREAT leap and recount either an earlier Snake Plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling..I also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer...""Carpenter....Russell! "" Please don't tell me ""money"" caused you to revisit a ""cult figure""! Some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of  Cliff Robertson, Stacy Keach, Steve Buscemi, and Pam Grier.  Robertson, Keach, and Grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters!Sorry, Snake....""I don't love L.A.""The-Big-Green-Pointy-Eared-One! "	0
I was very disappointed with this second edition. My daughter and I loved the first action filled movie and had hoped this would be just as exciting.  The movie dragged out for the first half, and just got worse during the second half.  I continually kept looking at the clock, wondering when it would be over.  We only watched it once, and it will go in the rummage sale later this year	0
Happy Gilmore is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Then I watched Billy Madison and it was about a totally moronic spoilt rich kid. Total opposites sometimes don't atract.	0
I first viewed this movie on cable, that same night, I purchased the movie from this seller.  To date, I have had no responses to email, no communication what so ever, and still have not received this tape in the mail.  Very disappointed, and not recommended to purchase from this seller	0
"This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played. ""Eight Women"" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. ""Eight Women"" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies.Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange.By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience."	0
"That's all I could think of when my family and I sat down to watch this movie together.  We had told the story to our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails in a small chapel in Santa Fe.  The story itself is so powerful and moving. Built in the 1870s, the chapel was nearly complete when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit. The sisters' prayed a novena to St. Joseph and on the ninth day their prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived, built the ""miraculous"" staircase, and then disappeared without being paid. The staircase is a double helix with no visible support. It's 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals, and the wood used is not a known wood in any area near Santa Fee!This movie however is about a mother superior who has faith but harbors real resentment towards Indians and also likes to curse (how this has anything to do with the actual story I still have no idea!).  At one point when a nun is ""shocked"" to hear mother curse mother surperior responds ""Oh Margret get off the cross and get down here with the rest of us"".  When the mysterious carpenter shows up and starts to build the staircase, the architect and the contractor decide that this is a bad thing and threaten to kill the carpenter.  Meanwhile this carpenter who is sent by ""God"" builds the staircase with wood that doesn't work, is arrested after being falsly accused of attempted murder, and leaves everyone to believe vandalls destroyed the staircase when in fact he originally destroyed it before rebuilding it better.  In the end the staircase is built and this mother superior (who is on death's door) is so moved that she literally crawls up the staircase in a very ""weird""/""uncomfortable"" scene until she reaches the choir loft and dies.  Wow, inspiring.The best thing I could think of is this director and writer took a wonderful and moving story and turned it into a Hollywood flop. This was obviously written, directed, and produced by people who have no idea how the staircase was built but are pretty darn sure it wasn't a miracle because hey, miracles just don't happen. The acting was pretty good but the story was junk.  Unfortunately I bought this movie.  If you are looking for a true inspirational movie that you can watch with your family, rent or buy Mother Theresa with Olivia Hussey.  Hands down the best Saints movie every filmed.  Half way through the movie my 5 year old says out loud ""Wow, she REALLY cares about everybody!""  Inspirational movie, compared to this disappointment"	0
This is an adorable movie. It's low-budget and the acting is notspectacular, but nevertheless, it's a cute story with sexy characters and an impressive, unique plot.Conrad is a successful, attractive man recently heart-broken. Venturing into the unknown, he hires a sex worker for the night. As it turns out, his hired man, Ian, is quite the catch -- a young, charming, sexy Australian trying to save money to stay in the country. Soon enough, Ian is in Conrad's life every day, though not as you may think.As Ian moves into Conrad's social life, everyone's issues come to the surface. Love stories unfold and redevelop, problems at home collide with life at work, the truth behind Ian's need to do sex work comes out, and everyone is in for a wake-up call about life and what they need.Basically, it's genuine, it's cute and charming, and it deals with real-life problems, most of which just happen to be gay, a definite plus in my book. So give its budget a break and sit back and enjoy a film well-worth seeing.	1

THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra. This film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone. This is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies. Afraid to assert a viewpoint, the script meanders. Denzel Washington plays the Sinatra role of Ben Markoe. He seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines.  Washington, normally a gifted actor, plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role.Markoe discovers that his Gulf War comrade-in-arms, Raymond Shaw, soon to be the next Vice-President of the United States, has been the subject of mind control experimentation by Manchurian Global, a vast multinational conglomerate. Raymond's handler is his Senator mother (Meryl Streep in the role of an ice queen). By diluting the threat from Communism to Capitalism, the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story. After all, it is no great achievement to convince a major American political candidate to back big business, and so the grotesqueries of Shaw's brainwashing get lost against the backdrop, seeming less heinous than merely greedy, even when Shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious, amoral, and possibly incestuous mother.Why the film created the unlikely Manchurian Global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the Manchurian Global mindset that has gripped Hollywood. God forbid we should point a finger at mainland China (or anyplace else); it might reduce the bottom line. This film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray.Do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original. 	0
I really liked this product.  Easy to follow and you feel it everywhere.  I try to do it everyday.  My clothes are looking better on me and I have had to buy some new ones.  One of the best choices I ever made	1
"Victor Hugo's enormous output is unique in French literature... He was described as 'The most powerful mind of the romantic movement' and his novel, published in 1862, continued to be widely read...The plot - that of a detective - is as well the epic of the people of Paris... Its author claimed it as a 'religious' work, and indeed by means of its characters, sometimes a little larger than life, yet always vital and engaging, and by its re-creation of the swarming Parisian underworld, the main theme of man's ceaseless combat with evil clearly emerges while the whole gives a faithful picture of the declines and flow of life...Hugo relives his youth in this vast novel, the culmination of 14 years work... He and Valjean share their most outstanding characteristic: their charitable heart...The story contains glimpses of Hugo's disgust towards 'the treatment of the lower class French citizens by the government: Valjean, an ex-convict recently released from prison, but he is not given the opportunity to make a good living for himself; Fantine forced into prostitution due to the lack of money to pay her illegitimate child...And towards the 'general injustice of the law enforcement system: Valjean sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread; Fantine arrested for hitting a man of a higher class...The symbol of France's greed that Hugo despises is Thenardier - the man that Fantine entrusts Cosette to - who betrays the trust by essentially making Cosette his personal slave...The strongest emotions of ""Les Misrables are love and hate...Javert and Valjean are both extremes, with a conscience incredibly strict...Liam Neeson is cast as the gentle Valjean who takes the twist of fate parlaying it into personal success and moral rehabilitation... He changes his ways to become years later the much-loved mayor of Vigau, and as a caring businessman he struggles to forget the past and manages to redeem his soul becoming benevolent, giving manual and financial help to the weak, sick and poor...After nine years, Valjean was horrified to discover that Javert - a former guard of the Quarries of Toulon, where he served almost 20 years - has arrived to be the head of Vigau's police force...Valjean's desire to protect the employees from bad influences leads him to fire (indirectly) one of his workers Fantine - turned prostitute... He assumes responsibility for raising her daughter Cosette... He becomes a father figure and soon forces the choice of sacrificing his own freedom for her happiness...Geoffrey Rush plays the icy chief inspector Javert, the man who tries ""to live his life without breaking a single rule."" When he is given the job of spying in the barricades and Valjean gives him his freedom instead of shooting him, things begin to fall apart for him...The action of mercy of Jean Valjean causes him to doubt the solid base of his existence... He is in emotional agony unable to betray his convictions... He sees too late the truth...Valjean's legendary physical strength are enough to stir his suspicion that the town mayor is a fraud... He is less villain than a man driven by his own hard concept of justice begging permission of his superiors in Paris to investigate the mayor, the man he believes is a convict...When he thinks he has made a mistake in identifying Monsieur Le Maire as the 'convict' Jean Valjean, he insists on informing him that he has denounced him unjustly and that therefore he must be dismissed: ""You must punish me"", he says, ""or my life will have been meaningless."" (A key line in the film).Uma Thurman approaches the self-indulgent character of Fantine with admirable restraint, giving a certain level of charm and charisma to the film... She gives her sick mother role a good amount of realism demonstrating her character's frustration and pain exquisitely...Fantine's misery overwhelms her as she sells her body to support her child... Being in a wild state, enraged at how she is a helpless victim of misery, she is arrested after being humiliated by several would-be customers, but Valjean intercedes on her behalf overriding Javert's authority...When Valjean helps her, she begins to rediscover hope... Her joy at the thought of having Cosette with her is great... But the shock of Valjean's arrest and the discover that Cosette is not there, are too much for the poor creature...Claire Danes plays the teenage Cosette who realizes one day that she has become quite beautiful... She disobeys her father's rules by secretly sneaking out and seeing Marius - a charismatic young Parisian revolutionary - with whom she fell in love...Cosette spends her childhood as a servant girl at the Thenardier's inn, horribly mistreated and constantly terrified... She grew up in a convent, innocent, pure and a bit nave...Peter Vaughan is excellent as the compassionate bishop whose act of generosity turns an embittered Valjean around...Bille August tries to capture the essence of Hugo's morality staging its political turmoil strongly enough to give it contemporary resonance, keeping the eternal three elements: the bishop handing over the candlesticks; Fantine's collapse; Marius crying out: ""To the barricades!""History doesn't change, as Voltaire once remarked... But what we need from it, does... Valjean's story is not unique, it's universal... In other world, it's contemporary... There are certainly enough ""Les Misrables"" to go all around the world... "	1
"Unlike many of the reviewers here, I'm not a biblical expert and really don't care if the movie adheres to the stories as they are portrayed in the bible. I would just judge the movie based on its entertainment value and ability to engage me emotionally.The biggest problem with this movie was that it simply seemed to be too long and drawn out. There were also some scenes that felt like padding and added nothing to the story (and in some cases detracted from it). For instance, during the long voyage while the earth was covered by water, everyone goes a bit crazy. That's an acceptable premise but it's played out theatrically for far too long and in a variety of embarrassing scenes for the actors. The idea that they suffered madness was fine to introduce but it shouldn't have taken up so much time nor been quite so adbsurdly plotted out like a little play.There were also a couple of ridiculous encounters on the water (between Lot acting as a pirate and a merchant who sold them various trinkets for water) which undermined the entire story of the great flood. Everyone was supposed to have perished in the flood and it was a bit absurd that a few would be sailing the high seas on little boats. It was just plain silly and, again, seemed to be put in just to pad the story or add unnecessary ""spice"" (it didn't work as a means of jazzing up the story).I'm guessing the writers felt the time on the water had to be long to show how Noah and his family suffered or had their faith tested but they also felt it had to be more interesting than just lounging on the boat and taking care of the animals. This type of insecurity with telling a story in the most effective way is what causes so many productions to go bad.To the movie's credit, the actors are quite good and there are some good moments but too much of the movie doesn't work."	0
"Having an M.A. in English literature as well as a B.A. in literature and history, anytime a movie is BOTH historical AND literary . . . well, I get a bit excited to say the least. I don't wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it's not, but the writers/directors/producers set it against a ""historical"" backdrop nonetheless. On that note, this is yet another stellar title from noneother than Ridley Scott. With that being said, I enjoyed ""Tristan and Isolde"" almost as much as ""Gladiator"" and a bit more than ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (all of these, by the way, are Ridley Scott films). Notice the historical adaptations here? While it may be true that the story of Tristan and Isolde was inspirational to Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the Arthurian legend, this movie is not exclusively for the high-browed college types. No sir, good ol' red-blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie. This is by no means a ""chick flick"" since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense. On the other hand, it's not the typical ""hack and slash"" macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story. In short, it should please both sexes simultaneously. Aside from James Franco (Tristan), I was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast. Sophia Myles (Isolde) is, for the most part, a newcomer to American audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly British films. I suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the Atlantic. While many of the other characters were convincing in their roles, no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant Irish king (who just so happens to be Isolde's father). In short, this is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. On some levels it reminds me of ""King Arthur."" Just as ""King Arthur"" attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot, so too does Ridley Scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the Angle and Saxon kingdoms in England. If you'll recall in ""King Arthur,"" Arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading Saxons just as the Roman legions were exiting Britannia. Historians will point out that there is no evidence of Saxons in England until several decades AFTER the Roman withdrawal, but oh well . . . it made for a good story. Here, we witness the Celtic Britons as they are exploited by the Irish across sea. WHAT???? The Irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around? Well, ""Tristan and Isolde"" holds true to history in this aspect; namely, that the Celtic Britons of England were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the Anglo-Saxons. This would, of course, have placed them in what is now Wales and Cornwall. And this is exactly where the movie is set. Let's not forget the story of Saint Patrick. Remember, he was actually a Romanized Briton who was captured and served as a slave in Ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to Ireland to convert the populace to Christianity. It's interesting to note that in the movie Christianity is a fairly new-fangled religion in Ireland, so no doubt Ridley Scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand. I particulary liked ""King Arthur"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics. Critically speaking, ""Tristan and Isolde"" has been a bit of a mixed bag as well---but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics? Rent it first if you must, but I suspect this one will be a ""keeper"" in your DVD library! "	1
if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you. ninjaman, elephantman, nitty kutchie, boom dandemite, harry toddler, and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie; which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick. the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all at the acting thing...	1
I saw this movie twice, the second time knowing exactly why I wanted to see it again. If you are trying to find out if you love someone or not, make sure that you see this movie. Such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives. Explains why we are where we are, and makes you part of the harmony. Is love as simple as teaching someone to bike? Think about it. If there are no rules against it, this film should be renominated for Oscar.	1
Four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction, loaded with drugs with Paul McCartney in charge -- what do you get?  Magical Mystery Tour.  With no plot, great music, this plays as a too-long music video without purpose. OK if you're a Beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967.  But if you weren't a Beatles fan then there is no reason for this.  At least A Hard Days' Night with Richard Lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers - but this?  Too many drugs and too much ego and no direction.  That's all. 	0
Really worth seeing to learn about the life and talent of Budd Boetticher.  The collectors edition allows you to watch for the elements of the film that make it special	1
"This movie classic, is a fabulous movie.  The story represents a common dilemma faced by 1st generation young people whose parents are immigrants.Here is this sensitive, kind-hearted fellow, Marty, a butcher, who just wants to meet a nice girl and get married. Nobody really wants him to be happy and have his own life, especially his mother, and his aunt.  These two actors play their character parts perfectly, just like real ""battle-axes"" from the ""old country,""  etc.  They gossip and try to ruin his relationship with a nice girl he has just met. It is hilarious and entertaining and very true to life.  I love watching this movie over and over"	1
VCI's budget DVD starts out well enough for the obscure thriller Lady Ice, with nice letterboxed credits foreshadowing interesting widescreen photography to come. Unfortunately, as soon as the credits end, the aspect ratio changes to full screen and the rest of the film is presented in one of the worst pan and scan jobs I've ever seen on DVD. Pass on this one from VCI, and hopefully down the line there will be a new widescreen transfer so we can see how the film is supposed to look after the credits.	0
"When I first purchased the low-budget movie named ""Pranks"", I didn't really know what to expect.  After all, ""Pranks"" is a slasher/horror movie from the 80s, a very fertile period for such movies and time period which quite honestly produced some pretty good slasher and horror movies in general...unfortunately, after viewing ""Pranks"", I can honestly say that this is not one of them.""Pranks"" is about a group of college kids who are staying on campus over the holidays preparing a building which is going to be torn down I think (herein lies another problem in that it is very difficult to understand what is going on in this movie because the acting is so poor).  Obviously, most kids have gone home for Christmas and New Year's except for this group of kids and one ""weird"" kid who ostensibly becomes the lead suspect as gruesome murders begin to occur.  The murders remain largely unbeknownst to the characters in the movie, so the director and screenplay writer wanted to give the audience information to which the main characters are not privileged.  The plot is decent enough although the execution is formulaic/generic and lacks luster throughout the film.  One of the reasons for this is the pathetic acting we see in this movie, which really overshadows any kind of merit this movie is able to produce as a horror movie.  There is no question that ""Pranks"" is a low budget production to begin with and along with that, there is going to be some subpar acting, but the acting in ""Pranks"" is borderline-awful!!  It is this acting and poor direction that really makes it difficult for the tasteful horror movie viewer to stay interested.  In fact, the movie comes off very generic in style and substance, and rather predictable and boring.  The only thing that is even remotely interesting are the kills which aren't too bad considering the era in which this movie came out from.  The Director does use some weak misdirection to attempt to keep the audience guessing as to who the killer is, but the savy horror movie audience can clearly identify the ""weird guy"" as a ""red herring"" as another reviewer put it.  In summary, ""Pranks"" is a poorly executed attempt at a horror movie which suffers from terrible acting, extremely poor production values and flawed direction.  The result is a dull, boring and weak horror movie with a few decent kills...certainly nothing to write home about.  Also, as a final note, the actor who plays the killer does a terrible job and comes off, in the end at least, like a total wuss"	0
"""Dave"" is a lot of fun, as a look-alike gets to pretend to be president, gradually gets a big head and tries to use the power, and makes high-stakes enemies. I am a big fan of Sigourney Weaver, and she is very good here. Kevin Kline does well, as well. The forces of good beat back the dark side of politics for awhile, and an ordinary guy finds extraordinary adventure and true love. Definitely worth a rental, if romantic and comic politics with a bit of danger is your bag"	1
My best friend got this movie at her birthday and i watch it at her house it WAS SO FUNNY!!!!!! Anybody who love SPONGEBOB will LOVE this MOVIE!!!!!!	1
The casting here was excellent - Ben Stiller, Elle Macpherson, Sarah Jessica Parker were all great. In fact, I am convinced that Elle Macpherson can act because of the 3 movies I have now seen her in, she plays decidedly different people in each one. She is perfectly cast as Joe's dream woman. I found Eric Schaeffer's character the least appealing of the whole cast. Some of the jokes here are wildly funny.  The audience is never given a clue that the Jane Lindquist character is only getting involved with Joe to indulge the fantasy world he had created of her. I thought it was odd that she enjoyed his voyeurism and then seemed honestly interested in him sexually, but was not interested in a relationship with him. Earlier her character makes a statement that the world makes too much of the sexually charged days in the beginning of relationships, people move on after that part is over and that a lasting relationship is what she wants. That part did not make sense. This could have been improved by some better writing and better character development. The humor here is what makes this worth watching	1
"The characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting. An effort to watch. Make-up, dyed hair, costumes poorly done. One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene. The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: ""His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving"". This line is an exception to a lifeless script. There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: ""No man suffers pains of love on the stage."" For dealing with the infatuated man: ""You have wounded yourself, but not with love."" This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way. Well-made period romance films are: ""Pride & Prejudice 2005, 1996, & 1940"", ""Wives & Daughters"", ""North & South"". Fairly made is ""Under the Greenwood Tree"". I rated ""Persuasion"" at 2-stars for the wooden acting; however ""Persuasion"" is 5-stars compared to this ""Mansfield Park"". ""Persuasion"" has attractive scenery, costumes, beautiful singing, and an uplifting plot; though of interest only to women, preferably who have already read the book. "	0
"I like almost all of Lifetime's movies and love tuning in to watch but this was certainly not one of the best. The name bring ""obsessed"" was not what it should have been called, the lady was dreaming and had an illness. This movie had a horrible twist which made the ending bad and hard to follow and understand the whole way through, this movie was not what I had expected. As I said I like almost all of Lifetime Original Movies but I definitely wan't be watching this one again. "	0
  This is the all time, great, original classic.  The remake is .......okat best.   Add this to your classic movie collection.  Highly recommended	1
I bought The Homecoming 3-4yrs ago, and I watch it every year at Christmas.  I found it on the floor in my house after Hurricane Katrina, still in the package it came in.  I brought the DVD to my new place of residence and popped it in the player and it has been playing since I found it.  When ever I'm down it watch it, so I can relieve some of my own childhood memories of the season.  It is a must see for the young and old	1
"I really liked this film.  Before Michael Moore became a liberal celebrity, he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker.  This film was a major underground hit at the time, and it still is excellent today.  You really feel for the people who lose their jobs, and you're infuriated by the callous indifference of Roger Smith and the management of General Motors.  I really liked the segment where Flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the Midwest.  It consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a Hilton in downtown Flint, and opening up a theme park called Auto World.  It justs smacks of desperation and stupidity; it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time.  Instead of giving these people really good jobs again, they come up with this idiotic scheme, which ended up in disaster (both the Hilton and Auto World closed within a year).  Moore in recent years has become a ""political celebrity"", in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in America.  It's not just Moore doing it; right wingers like Hannity and Coulter have been doing it too.  They all got books; some of them got films; some of them have radio shows.  A lot of them aren't really interested in changing anything, as it might interfere with their livelihoods.  I don't know if Moore is like that or not.  But this is still a potent, darkly funny film about real class warfare, and the dismantling of the working class in America.  "	1
This is a great DVD for all collections even if the movie stank which it did not.  The package is worth the coin.	1
Not worthy of The Firm name, this workout was repetitive, boring and doesn't belong in a Firm lineup.  If you're a true Firm believer and LOVE the originals, DON'T waste your time with this one, it will only disappoint	0
"As the reviews below indicate, ""Arthur"" has a lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 Vincent Canby of the New York Times found it a wonderful ""screwball comedy"" (although over time, Times readers, perhaps more discerning than Vincent, have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars) and Bravo listed it #10 on its list of Best Comedies (see below). I first saw Dudley Moore in ""Foul Play,"" thought he was very funny. Based upon that, I bought ""10"" and ""Arthur,"" as it turned out a downward trajectory.What I dislike about ""Arthur"" is Moore playing a loud, obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes, and Minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves Arthur for himself, not for his $750 million fortune. Even John Gielgud, who was great in ""The Loved One"" a much better comedy, can't resurrect this turkey.Okay, folks. Start casting your negative votes.

"I lived through the vietnam era.  IF you did you can't ever forget.  This guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us.  Here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong, why it went wrong and what we can learn to KEEP FROM REPEATING IT.  For me, here was the most unforgettable moment.  Decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days.  Macnamara tells him we--the americans--were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism, seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china.  The north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said, ""Mr. Macnamara, you must have never read a history book!  We've been FIGHTING the chinese for a thousand years!  We aren't their puppet!  We were fighting for our national freedom!  We would have fought to the last man!""  Macnamara says they almost came to blows.Here's the point.  Macnamara says, as compared to say the soviets, we didn't understand the north vietnamese.  We didn't really know enought about them.  We had no idea what was in their minds.  And that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons!  That's why we lost!Does any of this sound familiar??????  This is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age.  It's that good and that informative.  Of course, it won't be widely viewed by the american public.  We'll go our goofy way coveting our big-screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things--like sporting events"	1
I was very disappointed with this show. Having read the reviews I decided to buy the dvd, now I feel cheated. The jokes are weak, his inaccurate depiction of Africa and his off-the-mark African accent were more annoying than amusing. Jamie was crude, disgusting and even more disappointingly, not funny at all. He will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn't his best performance. He had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly. I do not recommend this dvd at all	0
"I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's ""performance"" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$"	0
I can't wait to all the seasons of Dallas are available	1
Why?Why waste your time and money on producing crap?Sony execs must be out of their minds. The Ghostbuster fans have been waiting years, and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on DVD, and this is what they come up with?No. Give us season DVDs. Give us a 140 episode box set. Give us something. Not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that can hold MANY times that.What a waste. This product gets 1 star because, apparently, you can't give it zero	0
This DVD gives a very good 60 minute workout. As others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy. The first time I did it, I felt a bit awkward with the steps, but when I did it the second time I was able to follow along with no problems. The dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine. If someone like Denise Austin were leading this one, I don't think I would play along. Minna is by far my favorite instructor, so I go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout. I wouldn't want to do this every day, but it is good to have something different in the rotation.I think the toning section is excellent. I am not looking to bulk up. I just want my body to firm up and look better when I wear shorts and a tank top. I like how she combines upper and lower body exercises. It's easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes. I use 3 pound weights at this point and I can see where in the future I might be buying 4 pound weights. Minna is a great instructor. She has excellent cueing and is very encouraging. She is never annoying. I also have her Optimizer- Balanced Blend DVD and I love that one.	1
"I think I understand what Camp is.  ""The Damned"" is a film taking upon itself the allegorical rise and fall of Nazi Germany in such an overindulgent manner that one cringes and giggles at the same time.  I guess Gay folks everywhere can blame Luchino Visconti the ""great"" director for making a laughing stock out of homosexuals in Nazi SS garb.  Mel Brooks realized in his film ""The Producers"" that Nazi's are damn funny, but not even Brook's vision could foresee the downfall of the Essenbeck family as the currents of early Nazi bloodshed swirls about.  The uniforms are Art Deco at its worst.  The young blonde, Aryan, cross-dressers are a bathhouse dream until they're lined up against the wall.  Rome may have had Caligula, but The Reich had blonde pedophiles. What a thrill to see Helmut Berger swishing about in Marlene Dietrich bodice and stockings.  I watched the whole thing and I'm going to end this review to take a shower"	0
The first half of this movie starts out promising; the 2nd half is not so good.It becomes slowly predictable and stereotypical, whereas it started out charming and promising.Of particular annoyance is the ending, where we find the hackneyed politically-correct stereotype of the husband having to admit culpability for all the wrongs of the couple's separation, and the woman never having to admit her half of the bargain, despite the fact that she was clearly as poor a communicator as he.Indeed, the wife's character is strikingly uneven in this movie: her personality appears to be one thing in the first half of the movie, but she seems to become a whole different person by the second half. Quite inconsistent	0
After watching this movie I wish an asteroid would hit Earth, or the movie studio that put it out.  And what a lame 4th of July scene.  I hope the movie extras in that scene didn't get paid, especially the putz in the white t-shirt.   Geeeesh what a waste of video tape. 	0
 All of these bad reviews confuse a movie they didn't like with a badly made movie. This is a very well made movie, with perfectly competent performances. The tone is quite serious, and the ending won't cheer anyone up. But then there are many people who loved Titanic, which I found utterly depressing. More to the point, though, who cares about the problems of these rich kids? Not me. The REAL reason to watch this is to see Molly Ringwald at her most beautiful. And if you enjoy this film, check out Less Than Zero, another gloomy but solid (& underrated) '80s film. The WORST '80s film is Bright Lights, Big City - don't say I didn't warn you!	1
This has got to be the absolutely the sickest bottom of the heap horror movie ever made. You have been warned	0
DO NOT PASS THIS ONE UP. BUY THIS AMAZING DVD AND YOUR EARS WILL BE SATISFIED..	1
Very few people remember Sandra Bullock starring on the short-lived CBS sitcom Working Girl which was based on the 1988 20th Century Fox film of the same title starring Harrison Ford,Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver. Very few remember Bullock's appearance in the 1991 film LOVE POTION #9. This film catapulted her to superstardom. She stars opposite Keanu Reeves and all hell breaks loose with both of them recklessly driving commercial buses. In the twelve years since this film debuted on the big screen,Bullock relentlessly made films to this very day. Also back in 1994,Hollywood had another megastar,Jim Carrey whose starring debut ACE VENTURA-PET DETECTIVE grossed over $5 million at the box office. Unfortunately,SPEED 2,released in 1997,never acuumulated audiences as large as the ones who saw the first film	1
This video is great for the beginners and the advanced beginners.  I started taking a Vinyasa class and was unable to coordinate my schedule with class times so I looked for a video to supplement my practice at home.  What a great choice.  Baron Baptiste takes his time to explain the poses and provides the mood that is needed to practice yoga at home.  I highly recommend this DVD	1
I have watched arthurs perfect christmas a couple of times ontv. I live in australia and no arthur d.v.ds not realy any videos either have come out. So could you please bring some out to australia. This is a must see for any arthur or non arthur fan!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
"I was intrigued by ""Satan's Little Helper"" due to several things namely its Halloween theme, which I'm a big sucker for, and the heralded return of Jeff Lieberman to the horror scene.  Lieberman made 4 minor cult horror films in the 70's and 80's, the last one being 1987's ""Remote Control"".  You would think that Lieberman, with all this time off from filmmaking would have spent his share of time carefully observing horror films in order to craft a good one when he would choose to return.  Well, it almost feels like Lieberman is stuck in some kind of time warp, as this movie looks like it came straight from the 80's due to how cheesy, trashy, cheap and godawful it is.  Many, myself included, look upon the 80's slasher craze with fond nostalgia but this is one film that reminds us how truly bad some of those films could be.The ""plot"" revolves around a 10-year old boy who is a huge fan of the video game ""Satan's Little Helper"".  It's now Halloween season and his mom buys him a devil costume, which he wears proudly.  One afternoon, he spots a tall man wearing an equally devilish costume dragging bodies around to serve as Halloween decoration stiffs for the front of his house.  He becomes enamored with the tall & mute masked man and asks him if he can be his helper.  The two then go on a rampage throughout the small suburban community, as the masked man kills people randomly in gruesome fashion all the while the boy (whose intelligence quotient appears to be much closer to a 5-year old than a 10-year old) inexplicably thinks it's all still a game of make believe.If you think the plot sounds bad that's nothing compared to how poorly this movie is executed.  Nearly everything about it is god-awful from the camcorder film quality, to the laughable gore effects (including the least-ever convincing intestines I've ever seen) and especially, the acting. The 10-year old boy, who appears in nearly every scene, makes a run for most annoying child actor in recent memory.  The acting on just about everyone's part is bad, and the characters all come across as being mentally retarded from the clueless boy to the mute villain who kills for no apparent or explained reason, the flaky sister and the eccentric, kooky mother.  There is not a single character we can give a darn about and we don't care the least bit when someone gets killed.  Granted, dumb characters who do dumb things in horror movies are a dime a dozen, but these ones truly take the cake.  I'm a little baffled as to why this movie has gotten its share of enthusiastic reviews.  I'm thinking some people are going to put this in the ""so good it's bad"" category but I'm not having it.  Some of the scenes in the movie that were meant to be ""funny"", such as the parking lot scene where the villain and boy knock off a pregnant woman, an elderly lady, and a stroller carrying a kid, are downright appalling.  The villain himself is a bad joke, as he doesn't utter a single word throughout the film, instead delivering thumbs-up signs to the kid and wagging his finger.  Cheesy?  Heck, this film is cheesier than a Black Diamond factory.  ""Satan's little helper"" comes across as the work of a first-time wannabe horror amateur with no budget, not something from a guy in his fifties considered a cult filmmaker.  To sum up how I feel about this film, I will repeat a line that I see all over Amazon that I usually feel redundant but somehow I find to be entirely fitting for this movie.  DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS GARBAGE!! "	0
"I will make this short.  Aykroyd, Candy two men who are hilarious together is of course hilarious.  The story is about a man who loves his family and is a middle class man going on vaction.  His relatives decide to join him without letting him know.  The relatives are totally diffren't from the family they join and seeing them mingle is a riot.  I say get this movie because everyone I know who has seen it all say the same thing  ""I love that movie, it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen."	1
"DVD #1 presents a terrific hour-long history of the franchise.  It hits both the high- and lowpoints, and indicates why the Packers are a national treasure and probably the greatest team in NFL history.  Lambeau, Hutson, Lombardi, Starr, Nitschke, the Ice Bowl, Favre, White, the nine NFL championships, the three Super Bowls they won (I, II, and XXXI), and the one they lost (XXXII).  The best fans in the league, the smallest venue, the most legendary stadium, and the team's miraculous survival over 80+ years, in no small part because they are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by their fans.  The highpoint, of course, is the 15-minute section entitled ""Lombardi"" which encapsulates the Green Bay career of the NFL's greatest coach--but at the end of this DVD about the Packers' heroic ongoing history, you realize that as great as Lombardi was, the team is greater still.DVD #2 was produced earlier in VHS format (I bought it at the Packer Pro Shop in GB) and portrays the greatest game in Packers history and one of the greatest in NFL history. Other reviewers have justly praised its play-by-play reconstruction and modern-day interviews with the participants.  Yes, Kramer was offside--but luck is a part of any game, and the Cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second quarter.  Like another reviewer, I love the postgame interviews, even the glimpses of Green Bay in 1967.  The muted colors of the frigid game (maybe Packer jerseys actually were that dark in the 60s--I see the same thing in footage of other games) and the elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a world that is now departed.

I was never a diehard Huey Lewis fan but this group definitely adds to that genre we call rock n roll. If you're looking for another dvd you can add to your concert collection, this one is worth the price of admission. I'm not familiar with all the original members so just having Huey as the front man and with the other members cranking out the songs as I remembered them, it was memorable, high-energy performance. One little thing was somewhat of a distraction to me. About halfway through the show, Huey's shirt had a meltdown. All of a sudden it looked like he got caught in a major downpour. Am I the only one that noticed this? But it just goes to show the man was giving it all he had. Who could ask for more	1
I have now seen about twenty Asian horror films, and this series definitely ranks among the best.  I have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles, but suffice it to say that these movies make Audition look like a Disney romance.  Bleak, bizarre, and ultra violent, yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent.  This film maker has something to say, and will beat you senseless to make his point.  In short, if you want to see Ringu #25, stay away from this one.  If you feel a bit more adventurous, I highly recommend this series	1
"This is the definitive lesbian love story that launched the genre in a new direction.  Out of the dirty bars and masculine flannel shirts, away from the creepy angst of punks.  This wonderful love story brings lesbian love into the light of day with beautiful women, looking and acting sexy, and leading productive, respectable lives.  WHY NOT portray lesbians as beautiful, educated, clean, classy, talented, sober, drug-free, non-violent, non-""self-destructive"", straight forward, honest...oh, and truly SEXY??  The Reno landscape in the 50's is a great backdrop for the conflicts that lesbians encountered.  The filming is top notch, the sets and period clothing are spot on.  The musical scores are superb!  The cast was wonderful!  Charbonneau and Shavers are sensational as total opposites who eventually become drawn and attrated to each other.  Just a masterful duette of performances!  Cay, free and fully out, forward and knowing just what she wants; Vivian, tentative and reluctant to step outside of her cultured and closed box.  Every minute they spend with each other oozes electricity and sexual tension. Two georgeous women making love??  HELLO!  The love scene is landmark.  Audra Lindley is wonderful and perfectly cast as Cay's stepmom.  Cay's best friend, Silver, is absolutely a key role in the dynamics of these chracters; she is the definative support and validation that these women are wonderful people, and deserve love and happiness.  We all need a little ""Silver"" in our lives!! This story is completely intriguing, and HEY, what a wonderful ending!  SEQUEL, SEQUEL!!! This is an absolute must have in any collection.  Timeless tale of the beauty of lesbian love.  "	1
"Plot Summary: A man-without-a-memory found floating in the Mediterranean Sea searches for his identity, discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly-trained government assassin.Reason for the Rating: Violence and some language.Based on the Robert Ludlum-authored book by the same name, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is part action flick, part stylized thriller. In his first role as an erstwhile action hero, Matt Damon shines as Bourne, imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't-know-who-he-is ease.As the story opens, Bourne is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an Italian fishing boat. The ""hey, this is a story about espionage"" theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from Bourne that displays what we later learn is a Swiss bank account number. Upon finding and opening the safe deposit box, Bourne discovers multiple passports (including one with the name Jason Bourne), a variety of foreign currency, and a gun. He then begins his search to uncover his true identity--and until now, so does the audience.If there is one misstep in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, it may be the fact that early scenes involving the CIA and the agency's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to Bourne's identity far earlier than Bourne himself. At this point the film becomes more of a ""how will he survive?"" thriller rather than a ""who am I?"" mystery.A love interest of sorts (played nicely by Run Lola Run actress Franka Potente) gives Bourne a ""partner in crime"" to play off of for much of the movie, but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development. An implied (off-screen) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief, but doesn't detract too much from the action.The most interesting (and morally significant) moment in the film comes when Bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on. Through this pivotal flashback (and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense), we learn that the highly-trained killing machine isn't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target's children in the room with him. Bourne's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film's premise as he is shot, falling into the Mediterranean Sea.Smartly directed, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is fast-paced without feeling rushed. The Cinematographer paints the European setting in shades of grays and yellows, giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama. As an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities, this film is a winner for older teens and adults.Nappaland.com Recommends: Ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride--THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a worthy discovery.After the Show...If members of your family choose to view this movie, use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward:---What do you think prompted Jason Bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht? What does this say about Bourne's moral compass?---How would you feel if you suddenly couldn't remember who you were? What actions would you take to discover your identity?---When faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done, Jason Bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew. When have you felt that way? How can a relationship with Jesus give us a ""second chance"" in the truest sense?S"	1
"Joe Versus The Volcano is a rare blend of comedy and insight that's romantic enough for girls, funny enough for guys, with effective visual symbolism, and appropriate for the whole family.  Maybe it could be described as an allegory for escaping the drudgery of life, or something like that, but at any rate it's pleasant to watch, at times profound, at other times funny. The beginning 3rd is about Joe (Tom Hanks) struggling with hypochondria and a lousy, really crummy job, primarily because of the dreary work environment and the typical (oppressive) supervisor (Dan Hedaya). (I've been there myself, when I worked at Pines Mfg H&H Tooling and again at Toro, where everyone was on dope.)  Joe learns from his doctor (Robert Stack, of The Untouchables) that he has a ""brain cloud"" and only a few months to live.  The tone of the movie rises as Joe quits his job and we feel like impending death is the best thing that's ever happened to him. He takes a former co-worker (Meg Ryan) to dinner and seems to wake up to life for the first time.  The next day billionaire Lloyd Bridges (Airplane) enters Joe's life with a bizarre proposition:  Since he's dying anyway, why not literally jump into a volcano - for the billionaire's own financial motive - and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the meantime.  Joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur Ossie Davis (The Client) and the billionaire's two daughters - both played by Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle), which makes a total of 3 roles for her in this great movie, making it even more pleasant to watch"	1
"Bulworth is ostensibly Warren Beatty's brave political satire in which a conservative senator suddenly starts liberally voicing those opinions that the rest of us are supposed to be thinking but are afraid to say. He tells a black church congregation to, ""Put away the malt liquor and fried chicken and stop supporting running backs that stab their wives."" If that's what you were thinking, you'll love this movie.Otherwise, Bulworth is jaw droppingly bad. To take such a hight position as to attack Beatty for suggesting that black characters need a white powerbroking partriarch to come to his senses before their concerns can be publicly considered is to give Bulworth way more credit than it deserves. It's distinguished from movies that are simply ""bad"" through its inclusion on the short list of truly dangerous ones. Not content to be racism hiding in plain site, Bulworth's racism is disguised as its own solution. Drug dealers have their transactions justified as the only commercial avenue open to otherwise well-intended African-American youths. Nina (Halle Berry) articulates an informed point, and it's a joke because attractive young black women look funny when they talk smart, like high-grammar versions of Zip Coon. In so doing, Beatty reminds black Americans that no matter what they accomplish, we know who they really are.However limited the potential of the opening premise (Bulworth plans his own assassination for insurance purposes before inevitably changing his mind), the film never approaches the kind of Farley Brotheresque world that would have been its natural destination. The sincerity of the politician's catharsis is hidden from us, both because his new outlook is originally motivated only by the insurance scam and because once Beatty starts rapping his lines, he NEVER stops, making the actor (as opposed to the character) look uncomfortable for the duration. That this movie lured audiences and critics into its didactic spell is astonishing.The film's ambition to be more than a cute little movie while being exactly the opposite reminds this reviewer of Roberto Benigni's embarrassing ""Life is Beautiful"" from the year before. Both have to be seen to be believed"	0
A musician's story.  All factual and carefully done, showing a gathering of Cuban jazz greats after many years of not performing.  Good photography, interesting scenes and good music.  They still play!  Well done	1
First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with  the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad. I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn's face.	0
"James, you wrote: ""Ben is weak, immature, a stalker, lazy, has bad taste in women and at 21 is unable to tell his parents no when they ask him to wear a scuba suit for their family friends. Wow! Revolutionary film-making...not!""   Yes, Ben was weak, immature, and had bad taste in women. His learning to overcome his weakness, immaturity, bad taste in women, and then defy his family and Elaine's family was his coming of age story.  That WAS the point of the movie.  It went right over your head!  The acting was dead on and the subject matter was shocker when it came out!  How could you not love this movie?  Maybe you need to grow up a little to see the value.  Watch it again in a few years.  I think you will change your low opinion of this great classic movie over time.     "	1
It took me all of 4 hours to read this book.  It was insightful and entertaining.  It was also sad.  I cried so hard at the end of the book that I hiccuped for 3 hours.  I work at a children's home and have passed this book to several of my 'children' who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face ANY TYPE of challenge, whether mental, physical, financial, whatever	1
This was the word used by one reviewer, and it just about sums up the film. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head by saying that many young wannabe creative persons start off with highly auto-biographical and introspective pieces of work. Usually these are binned, as the person matures. Asia seems to have the advantage of a parental environment sufficiently indulgent and well-heeled to let her have her way on film, instead of on scraps of paper like the great majority. But good art is more than self-expression, self-promotion, self-pity and self-indulgence. It should have a satisfying underlying form, say something new to its audience, expose some as yet unperceived truth about life and humanity. Art is boring if it merely tells us something we already know, especially if it's told in a semi-familiar way. Most of what Asia says in this film we do already know, if we are half-aware of what goes on around us. Still, the girl has a cute face, and she's put a lot of effort into this performance. Something more may come with time.  	0
"Cast:  Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini, Elias Koteas, Gabriel Casseus, Michael J. Pagan.Running Time:  123 minutesRated R for violence and language.""Fallen"" starts with convicted serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice Detective Jon Hobbes (Denzel Washington) looks on. Hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named Muscovich (Glen Witko) in a bathtub having been poisoned, the same way Reese used to kill his victims. At first Hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name Robert Milano comes up, a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide. Hobbes speaks with his daughter Gretta (Embeth Davidtz) who at first is reluctant to speak with him. Things become even stranger when the man who killed Muscovich, Charles (Robert Joy) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again. Eventually Gretta tells Hobbes the truth, he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called Azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch. The demon Azazel seems to be taunting Hobbes, ruining his life & career, setting him up for murder & getting to his friends & family. Hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him & everyone he cares about.Charismatic leading man Denzel Washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range, while John Goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to James Gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character. Donald Sutherland doesn't prove to have any range, doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies. Embeth Davidtz is a talented and totally under-rated actress. She delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future.  The directing and camera work in this movie was superb. It was done in such a way where you can see Azazel's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town.  Although this film does require your full attention, it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours.  ""Fallen"" is an intelligently written, supremely efficiently executed, and one of the most unheralded, unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade.  One of the better of its kind"	1
Great movie - there isn't anything I can say that hasn't been said 100 times. 	1
"I just watched this AWESOME DVD for the 1st time and it BLEW ME AWAY! The Corrs are the BEST!!!! However, my DVD didn't include a Booklet. Did anyone else get a Booklet with their DVD? Or does ""Live at Lansdowne Road"" not include a Booklet? Please post and let me know, thanks"	1
The so-called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic.  It is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor.  A three year old will laugh at anything.  Every turn of the plot is stupid.  This is in the running for the worst movie ever made.  I don't trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure.  I hope that Bruce Willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now.  I think he is a very good actor.  It's a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in, to get his career going	0
"Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a clever, insightful, and wicked film! It is not just another teen movie, though to the casual observer it might be. No, it is a time capsule into the SoCal lifestyle that pervaded much of the films of the late 70's and 80's as well as it is a time capsule into the mindset of teenagers all over the U.S. circa 1982.Sean Penn (whom I'm not a big fan of) as Jeff Spicoli is truly inspired! I find myself to this day trying to imitate his dead on surfer takes. What an awesome character. When he says, ""You d*ck!"" to Ray Walston's Mr. Hand (another inspired and forever memorable character), you just wanna roll on the floor!Jennifer Jason Leigh is nicely sweet and innocent as a junior high girl struggling with sexuality. Phoebe Cates as the girl who believes herself to be in the only truly ""mature"" relationship anyone has (with a college boy) is fresh and believable. Judge Reinhold as Leigh's older brother is inspired.Mike Damone is a sleaze and a great character (if only he really believed in himself as much as he wants others to).In fact, this film boasts huge numbers of young actors who went on to become stars. The script by a very young Cameron Crowe is brilliant!Fast Times came out at roughly the same time as The Last American Virgin and several years after Rock and Roll High School. Neither of those other films is anywhere on par with Fast Times. At times, light and airy, Fast Times carries a serious ""message"" that teen agers are truly finding their way in life in the best way they know how. It is somewhat inspired that we never actually see the parents of any of the kids in the film. The adults we see are those with whom they interact with outside the home: truly, teenagers feel that their young lives are more affected by people other than their parents.While Last American Virgin approached some of the same topics that Fast Times does, it did it in a more sinister way. Fast Times doesn't gloss over teen age problems, but puts them in perspective of how the teenager his/herself deals with them.Yes, it's a comedy and yes it is funny, but it is not just a film for kids"	1
"First, let me say, I LOVE Koyaanisqatsi, the original film in this trilogy. Koyaanisqatsi is a true visual poem that tells a straight forward story about what we humans are doing to the earth.The second film in the trilogy, Powaqqatsi, wasn't as good as the first but it was still fairly understandable as a critique of how humans exploit one another.Naqoyqatsi could have been the best in the series since it had ample opportunity to show us the horrors of war. Instead, it comes off as a sophomoric exercise in video experimentation, nothing more. If not for Philip Glass' music, I would not have given this film any rating at all.I write this criticism in hopes that Godfrey Reggio sees it. He should pull this travesty off the market and reshoot the entire film with stronger footage showing us, as clearly as he did with ""Koy"", why war (the topic of ""Naq"") is so horrific. If you want an effective critique of violence, try ""Clockwork Orange"". Naqoyqatsi is simply a mess"	0
all things aside, the other kid in the movie the caddie friend that has the episode at the end [stated this way without ruining the ending]played a great part as a supporting actor. his name is justin goncalves i think. this kid was very believable in every aspect of the part he played. in fact i think he stole the scenes when he was onscreen with the gamble kid. believability is important and this kid carried his weight the entire movie for what limited scenes he had. i was particularly impressed with the part he played.	1
This was the first silent film that I saw in its entire form. The 1927 King Of Kings, directed by Cecil B. Demille. As with D.W Griffth, Charlie Chaplin, and Greta Garbo, he is right up their amoung silent icons. This movie, starring H.B. Warner as Jesus is a truely a jewel of a film. Everyone knows the story, but it is told very well here. Demille knew his bible films, like Ten Commandments(1924,1956) Samson And Delilah and this movie, The King Of Kings. The film maybe dated a tiny bit, but can the story of Jesus be dated. I love Jesus movies, like Jesus Of Nazareth, The Greatest Story Ever Told. The 1961 King of Kings, and the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell. And the story of Christ was also tackled in the 1916 D.W Griffth classic Intolerence. But this film is broughhow much t out in much better detail. The special effects are amazing for 1927, the crucifixion scene is astondishing,and a scene in color, which is the resurrection scene.The cast of characters is also amazing. In our era of movies, if you need a big scene, a will have only 100 people, and CGI the other tens of thousands. Since there was no CGI back in 1927, or computers for that matter, they directors like Demillie and Griffth had to actually get thousands of extras for there scenes in these epics. I know people think silents are boring but for an 18 year old, they are a gateway to the past. Without those groundbreaking films, no one would care about movies. Those early silents were the catalyst for what would become. I would recommend this film.  This movie is a true classic, no matter what religion you are	1
"Wow!  This movie is deeply entrenched on my list of worst movies of all time.  I watched it last night and I woke up in a bad mood.  Everything about it sucked except for the nudity (hence the single star).  I understand it was supposed to be something of a ""comedy"", but without a touch of reality, I found myself laughing at the movie instead of with it.  The acting is awful, the soundtrack is hideous and the plot is a joke.  Michael Caine's goofy appearance was accentuated with some GINORMOUS glasses... there isn't a teen girl alive who would find that ""sexy"".  When I saw the 'Blame it on Rio' reviews on this site, I felt the urge to hunt down every person who gave it more than 2 stars (many gave it 5!!), strangle them, then watch as they emptied the contents of their bowels all over the floor."	0
Jennifer Jason...Can someone PUHLeeze tell me why she ALWAYS plays the same role! ANd why all of her characters have seriously bad elocution!The so called ~Bostonish...or upper crust--east coast accent does Not include..slurring your words as if a consonant was too much WORK.  It as if her upper lip is never engaged at all..Not even to smirk!  Does she have a BOTOX complex..USE YOUR FACE..Including your upper lip...But then again...Maybe she was acting JUST like Dorothy Parker..WHo ahem..happens to be dead..!  ( no disrespect intended..)Jennifer Beals played her little tiny wee part with so much more depth and nuance..WHY didn't she play Parker..I believed her character!  Gwyneth..Love her..!  Bit part..but she added a much needed warmth to the film..I cared for one character..And the best part was his bit giving a financial report..I thought that was BRILLIANT..! BRavo..But Mr. Benchley was the most endearing and 3 dimensional character..THANK YOU..WIll someone Please make this film over..And Do it right..!  And don't just call up your buds..for a tupperware party and say..HEY..Lets make a movie..!  Dorothy Parker deserves MUCH MUCH better..I can't EVEN imagine the biting remarks she would print..How about..  'It's all about me..And I hated it..!But the costumes were nice..	0
"""Venom "" is one of those movies I thought I would hate because I heard so much negativity about it but I really enjoyed it ,being a fan of the 70's and 80's slashers I crave newer versions because I have seen all the other ones over and over again.Venom did NOT disappoint me.It starts off with action and never lets up.I found it to be one of my favorite new horror/slasher flicks,The voodoo angle was good but not overplayed ,I'm simple in  that I want to see a killer with an axe , machete butcher knife etc not a bunch of supernatural mumbo jumbo..I don't want to have to wonder"" was that a dream or was it real~!!"" As so many movies these days play off of.Give me an old fashioned slice and dice and I'm in heaven.and Venom gave me that , So I hope to see Venom 2 ,if so ,I'm there(For the record, Mr Jangles used the hook & Chain before Kane in see No Evil...).."	1
Git-r-done is a nonstop display of a brilliant comedic genius known as Larry the cable guy. Larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head, but end up doubling you over with laughter. His preformance will definitely torque your brain, so be prepared. There are a couple instances where Larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure. One such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun. I was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that Larry was just messing with me because we all know girls don't fart, they don't even have buttholes. He then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out EVER. Unless you are an idiot, you know you can't look like him without a strict training regiment, nice try Larry. He finally sounds off with an insightful and powerful anti-Hillary Clinton piece. This was the icing on the cake for me because when I think of intelligent political commentary, I think Larry the cable guy!!!!	0
"I remember watching this in high school. I thought it was great fun then and my kids think it still is now. Okay, we're not talking Academy award material here (Emmy?).Ralph, Bill, & Pam are back for the third and final season of this far too short series about a man who is given a suit by aliens that gives him super powers. He is teamed with an FBI agent to help the world survive itself. In the first few minutes Ralph looses the instruction book and must noodle out how to operate the suit. He runs into a few walls, literally. The first season was a little rough. The second season fleshed out the concept. This third season started to stretch its legs but the show was cancelled.I have looked for years for novels based on the show, to no avail. I even contacted Cannell to ask if I could write them. As Disney is half-heartedly working on a feature film based on the show Cannell wouldn't cut loose with permission. Alas, It would've been fun.Anyway, if you have the other two seasons you'll love this one. The only complaint/change I would make is having to play the theme song before each episode. I would've made it so you could hit the ""forward to next"" button and go right to the action. Also, the jacket plays a bit of the theme song. I wish they'd made it possible to change the batteries.Mike Hudspeth in St.Louis, Missour"	1

We have the kind of family where we promised that all ex's and all family children, blood related or not, would be family.  People think I'm strange because my friendship with my husband's ex and her family is so important to me.  She was visiting us and our granddaughter in Ontario, CAN, she lives in L.A. and she wakens to classical music every morning.  I decided to put on Concert for George, which always brings me to tears, but she never took her eyes off of the screen.  She especially enjoyed Ravi Shankar and his daughter's opening to the concert and educated us on what the music meant.  As I told my husband...no person I have shared this DVD with has ever left it with a 'so what' opinion.  They all loved it and I think, most of my friends have it by now, Beatle lovers or not.  Thanks to all who made this a tribute to George, but also a way to educate people about his talents, his many, many friends, his loving wife and son, all of whom, obviously adored George and his music, as do I....and my close friend Mary	1
"Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, ""The Descent"" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, ""The Descent""""The Descent"" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.Even though ""The Descent"" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.""The Descent"" is unrated and contains violence and language"	0
An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot;.  Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman	0
"The ""fake-news"" TV movie had already be done, and done better, ten years ealier as ""Special Bulletin"".  Where the first movie took its subject, nuclear disarmament and terrorism, seriously, this cheese-fest doesn't respect the viewers' intelligence at all.  They pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera.  Not of it ties together in any coherent way and the ""make love not war"" ending reeks of junior-high-school sophistry"	0
I am not a horror movie fan, in fact there are very few horror movies that have truly scared me, but this one indeed made me literally crap myself. I caught this movie during the midnight hours on IFC 2 years ago, and luckily the movie was just starting, so I got to see it from beginning to end. This movie is basically about a man named Frank Zito (Joe Spinell) who's a psychotic serial killer who seeks pleasure by killing women, because he feels he's getting back at his abusive mother who was also a prostitute. After her death Frank feels alone, but cannot forget the mistreatment he received from her all those years. Frank lives in a tiny apartment in New York City, in which he keeps several mannequins. He uses these mannequins by putting his victim's bloody scalps, on it's heads. When he spots a woman named Anna (Caroline Munro), a photographer in the park taking pictures he gains a sudden interest in her, but not the type of interest in which he wants to murder her, but kind of a romantic interest. He takes her out to dinner and buys her gifts, but will he change his mind about her, and make her become another one of his victims? Some of the scenes in this film are so incredibly gut-wrenching, especially the scene when he chases a nurse into a subway station, and she hides in a bathroom stall. I felt my heart pounding the whole entire time. The effects were realistic (Nice Job Tom Savini!), they don't come close to todays, even though the movie was released in 1980.  Joe Spinell plays this part so well that you might think he was for real, and not only that, but he physically looked the part too . The scenes where he's in his apartment talking to his mannequins are some of the most creepiest scenes I have ever seen in a movie. I believe that this film is one of the most realistic horror films out there, because we get to see the results of how an alone, mistreated child might turn out. This isn't one of those lame zombie movies, it's the real deal. If you like horror, and a lot of gore, and you haven't seen this then I recommend you watching this.  	1
A movie not geared for morons!  What a rare find.  There aren't many movies that can't be figured-out half way through.  This film is great; very clever.  Never saw the ending coming	1
First let me start off by saying this. Ken Sushi Volume 1 is unquestionably the BEST video guide for making sushi. I have had a chance to see the other guides, and quite frankly they just don't cut it. Poor camera work, and even worse instruction should not be found in a sushi instructional video (or any culinary instructional video for that matter). Also, being taught by a sushi enthusiast rather than a professional sushi chef is not going to send a very good message to people who are really serious about learning how to make sushi properly (people want to learn from someone experienced, not enthusiastic).Finally we have a video that is taught by a professional in the sushi scene, and he really takes the time to lay out all the techniques he's developed over the years, so that with a little practice (and the benefit of not having to take the time Ken did to trial and error his methods of perfect sushi creation) I was actually able to make some really great sushi.The camera work is GREAT! No shakes or stutters, I didn't find myself distracted by the nuances of poor production quality. Truthfully this video is done so well, you will just find yourself immersed in what Ken is teaching (it plays a LOT like a chef Martin Yan instructional video).Also it seems a lot of time was taken in pre production to really focus the instruction to a degree that it is thorough enough for someone familiar with sushi creation, yet developed enough so that someone completely new to the sushi experience can actually have a fair shot to making a wholesome, delicious dish.If you take the time to watch the video a few times, and practice along with it. You WILL make sushi good enough to eat, and present to your friends, family (just utterly show off).I'm just really glad I can finally say there is now a sushi instructional video that I feel was worth every penny of my purchase. If you want to really learn how to make sushi well, then Ken Sushi Volume 1 will be your number one resource. The only negative thing I have to say is where the heck is volume two????	1
Nothing beats this show.  Archie was recently rated the number 1 television character of all time by Bravo for a reason (Edith was number 12).  Highly recommend since the re-runs that are seen on various TV stations are chopped by about 2 1/2 minutes a piece	1
A style over substance celebration of the drag queen mentality - if you enjoy misogynist bitchy dialogue being delivered by pantomime women, this movie is for youElliot's love of drag queens overshadows the rest of this flimsy, contrived and lame narrative - clealry it's about getting as many shots as possble of drag queen costumes against the outback settingIt's alleged stance against homophobia and plea of acceptance of difference is trite and cringeworthyIf anything, this film reinforces negative stereotypes of gay men as nasty effeminate queens who are not to be taken serioulsy.Sadly it's been embraced by the same pandering gay men who think drag queens are 'camp' and therefore funny, indicative of how off the mark they are of what defines camp (go read Susan Sontag boys) and how low 'gay culture' as plummeted.There are plentiful nasty jokes targeting female gentilia, and a secondary racist commentary about Thai women 'entrapping' Aussie menTrashy and not in a good way. A must have for no brainer gay men.	0
Intimacy isn't about titillation or tanned toned Hollywood studs and babes having perfectly choreographed sex in beautiful lighting while poor piano music plays. Instead it's about an ordinary pair of people seeking solace in a purely physical relationship. Both are empty individuals and briefly find something to fire them in their weekly sexual meetings. Nothing is said but there is a purity of understanding.The relationship, and the film, only falters when the film moves outside the seedy flat that the liaisons take place in. The wordless arrangement can only work while everything is strictly anonymous, and once Jay (Rylance) delves into Claire's (Fox) personal life their apparently simple relationship becomes more complicated.It's also here that the film briefly slumps. Jay encounters Claire's taxi driver husband, played by an uncharacteristically off form Timothy Spall. Speaking nonsense and totally over the top, his scenes are almost unbearably dreary. I can certainly see why Claire would want peace and quiet and intense sex after listening to that intensely boring man twitter on. Still, it doesn't make his scenes any better to watch.Despite that though the film regains it footing and ends strongly. Even Timothy Spall's character shows some hidden depths! However, Intimacy works best as a comment on the relationships people trap themselves in. It's easier to stay in an unhappy relationship than walk out, and starting something new takes courage. Jay and Claire are unable to escape their empty lives, except in their sexual relationship. Really both are cowards. Neither is happy, but neither makes a serious effort to change their circumstances. Sex is a temporary answer to a permanent problem, and until they reach out for something more neither will be happy. The film had an increasing energy which I liked, and I'm sure you would like it too, if you let yourself inside the film.	1
I guess the reason I enjoyed the movie so much was because I went into the theatre expecting a good drama. And that's exactly what I got. The story was very interesting to me. I enjoyed the relationships between the villagers, especially Lucious and Ivy.The scary moments just added to the drama. Having grown up in the country, I know how scary the woods can be. I loved all the twists to the story.The only thing I didn't like was William Hurt's performance. It was too hammy. I think if this critical role had been cast by another actor, the movie would've moved along at a better pace.But still a great movie	1
"How families fall apart and mend themselves is the point of this star-laden 1996 movie, but stage and TV director Jerry Zaks, screenwriter Scott McPherson, and a trio of fine performances transcend the formulaic aspects to come up with something more resonant. Based on a play by McPherson before he succumbed to AIDS, the semi-autobiographical plot focuses on two estranged, middle-aged sisters. In Florida, mousey spinster Bessie has spent twenty years as caretaker to their ailing father Marvin and their eccentric aunt Ruth. In Ohio, Lee escaped family responsibility to get married and raise two sons in Ohio only to see things fall apart. Lee is on the verge of turning her life around as a licensed cosmetologist when Bessie is diagnosed with leukemia and reaches out to Lee and her sons as potential bone-marrow transplant candidates.The rest of the movie is mainly about how the sisters cope with each other when they reunite and what they do to deal with the inevitable. Intriguingly, while the soap opera elements are strictly by-the-numbers, there is a persistent undercurrent of black comedy that effectively blunts the potential sentimentality of the piece. It also helps that Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton play the sisters. As the embittered, guilt-ridden Lee, Streep moves easily back into blue-collar, Silkwood territory, and she unapologetically shows the edginess and jealousy of her self-centered character. However, it's a vanity-free Keaton who really radiates as Bessie finding inner strength and contentment under increasingly dire circumstances. A year before ""Titanic"", Leonardo di Caprio effectively plays the last of his juvenile hellions as Lee's oldest son Hank, a textbook example of teenaged, pyromaniac angst.The rest of the cast is fine in limited turns - Robert DeNiro (one of the producers as well) as the bumbling Dr. Wally; Dan Hedaya as his even more pixilated brother Bob; Gwen Verdon as wild-eyed, soap opera-obsessed Aunt Ruth; Hal Scardino as Hank's self-controlled little brother Charlie; and Hume Cronyn, who is forced to play Marvin with severely limited expression. There are predictable moments throughout, but some surprise and a few actually enthrall, including a seriocomic scene of quiet reconciliation when Bessie recalls the drowning death of her open-mouthed carny boyfriend. There are no extras with the 1999 DVD release"	1
This pilot is so bad, the acting, the writing, the directing, the costumes...  It's a miracle that B5 ever got even one season approved by the suits.  At least they could have gotten decent actors - pretty much, every character on this pilot is represented by a piss-poor actor.  And the writing is grade-school (I think this is what real people do) tripe.HORRIBLE, ROTTEN, USELESS JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
This is an excellent film. A lot of the topics that were discussed in this film still happen at HBCU's!!!! As a matter of fact, the issue of lightskinned vs. darkskinned is still going on today, on a college campus or not. Spike Lee to me is one of the best film directors of all time. He is not afraid to tackle issues that are in the African American community. I highly recommend this film. If you haven't seen it, get the DVD. It's a classic	1
"Sure, this was heaped with loads and loads of popular acclaim by the critics, but the question you should be asking yourself is, will it appeal to the average person?  The simple answer here is a loud and resounding NO.  Here are the reasons:  1) Unless you're a well-bred blue blood who knows all about Edward II and loves Shakespeare, this is extremely hard to follow, not just because of the archaic olde English-speake, but also due to choppy production and editing which impedes the plot coherence. Result? If you're not lost you will soon will be, and worse yet, you won't care; 2) Don't be fooled by the lure of Annie Lennox-she is an itsy-bit of a bit player in the overall run of this ""movie"" and is, for all intents and purposes, inappropriately placed in the middle of it much like the effect of having an MTV commercial rammed in the middle of your programme; 3) Let's be clear about what you're getting for your 10-15 dollars:  It's not a movie at all, but an arty-pretentious stab at cheap play production with less cinematography than your average soap opera or home movie.  Further, the ""period"" is thematically juxtiposed with costumes of old and new, making one more likely to ponder whether their budget was short, not what cutty-edgy-trendy-theme-within-a-theme are they trying to promote.  Who knew such a tantillizing, heart-wrenching piece of history could be rendered so dull?"	0
Moving, intelligent, realistic, not overly acted (as could quite easily have been the case).About a 20 year old who has gone off the rails to come back onto them again...you see why this has happened, feel sympathy, and just want him to do well when the film ends.A story about hope, in a world with little..	1
This film is one of my all time favorites. I think it's because these kids remind me of my friends and I as kids - riding our  bikes, going on little adventures, etc. The cast is absolutely perfect. Wil Wheaton was the best crying kid of all time - with the exception of Ricky Schroeder in The Champ. LOL. River Phoenix was excellent in this film, which is an adaptation of a Stephen King short story. Part road film, part coming of age tale, all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings.	1
The Concert in Central Park is not only the best of Simon & Garfunkel's concerts, it is one of the best of anyone's concerts, in my estimation. The crowd was really in to it, and Simon and Garfunkle responded to them and delivered a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of their music, and the era it was written in.I have owned the VCR tape for years, and enjoyed it many times, but the signal was beginning to fade, so I was very pleased to see it released on DV	1

"""Backbeat"" is an excellent portrayal of the Hamburg phase of the early Beatles, and succeeds on every level.  Although purportedly intended primarily to tell the story of ""fifth Beatle"" Stuart Sutcliffe, the focus quickly shifts to John Lennon who (as in real life) dominated the music and lives of the early Beatles.  It is as much the story of Stu and John as the story of Stu and Astrid, and explores the dynamics of both complex relationships.  Still, it is a fascinating look at the early Beatles, who paid their dues by playing in some of the rough Reeperbahn bars in the pre-fame years.  The cast is excellent, and were obviously chosen for their talent rather than their resemblance to the characters they portrayed.  The music is also excellent, and complements the story perfectly.  In all, ""Backbeat"" is an entertaining journey through the world of the early Beatles, and is well worth purchasing for repeat viewings.   "	1
The original CSI series is FANTASTIC because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence.  This series uses the CSI name without the investigating that makes the original so good.  It is mainly a mellow-drama surrounding the lives of the characters.  Some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor, but there's no mystery	0
"Since ""ER"" debuted on NBC in 1994, it's taken the nation by storm.  It's wonderfully produced by author Michael Chricton,  a former surgeon before his writing career.  For numerous years, it was the #1 drama series on television.  The show starts with the cast of Anthony Edwards (Mark Greene), George Clooney (Doug Ross), Sherry Stringfield (Susan Lewis), Noah Wyle (John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Carol Hathaway), and Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton).  It has since won and been nominated for several awards including Emmys.  Its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode.  Its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes.Season one introduces the everyday life in the ER in Chicago.  Throughout, it explores many critical issues including Hathaway's self-destruction that results in a suicide attempt, Carter struggling as a medical student, Ross living his sex obsessed life, and others.  Regular show viewers who haven't seen season one will see part of Lewis's reason for leaving Chicago in 1996, Greene in his first marriage and before Ella's birth (mother is Corday, who began in 1997), Deb Chin's (played by Ming Na) brief time in that ER as a medical student before returning as an official doctor in 2000, and many others.  Such combination shows partially how the show's theme evolved to today.  Episode by episode, the plot's quality stays on top.  The overall scenery, through the physical environment to the emotional drama, never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing experience.Season two features the debuts of Gloria Reuben (Jeanie Boulet) and Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver, not an official cast member until season 3).  This season explores Ross's most heroic act as a doctor, Carter becoming a doctor, Lewis being forced to care for her neice, and many more.  Today's viewers who haven't seen season two will witness Boulet before testing positive for HIV, Weaver before realizing her lesbianism, Hathaway before her today's happy life (though now in Seattle), and others.  This plot evolves very well in quality from the previous season.  It continues its run of staying on top in critical care and drama.Both seasons feature wonderful acting from the entire cast.  All add their own sense of individual theme into every scene.  Through personal struggles, drama, and continually saving lives, everyone gives the show its unique viewing flavor.Such show quality makes ""ER - The Complete First Two Seasons"" worthy for all fans.  This is sure to please its audiences.  New viewers should watch these two seasons first.  Otherwise, the plot will be confusing.  Fans should watch for season 3 to be released on video in the near future"	1
This was a film I was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects.  As far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment.  The acting was good but Robin Williams did not receive as much screen time as Ewen McGreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been.  But the major problem was the story.  Yes, it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak, boring at times and just silly.  I would recommend Ice Age or Garfiled: The Movie rather than this film	0
"""The Incredibles"", together with ""Finding Nemo"", ""Shrek 1 & 2"", ""Madagascar"" and the ""Spy Kids"" series, certainly mark a turning point in terms of animated moviemaking. Particularly The Incredibles is a movie no kid (or adult as well) will ever get tired of watching. As for the plot... it is just plainly great. Things have been kind of boring for superheroes since they have been forced to give up their superpowers and adopt a conventional lifestyle. But everything will change for Mr. Incredible and his family when an interesting business proposal will ultimately make him wear his superhero suit again for an exciting new job.My kids just love this movie (and so do I!"	1

Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex	0
"Ahh, ""Iron Eagle"".  A classic of the 1980's Golan-Globus production mill.  With the current spate of historic/""current"" military movies, it's sometimes good to see how Hollywood's come in trying to get the details right.  One can't do much better than using this flick as a baseline.  In case you aren't already familiar with this gem, Louis Gosset Jr. playing a reserve Air Force Colonel, and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed Arab country -OK I'll name it:  Libya- to rescue the kid's dad.  Pop gets shot-down when he's intercepted in international waters, but the US refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure.  The kid and Lou Gosset meet up when the kid's challenged to race the local bully with his PLANE while the bully's using his dirt bike.  Suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe; he doesn't get his slot at the USAF Academy, though. You gotta take the bad with good I guess.  When the words on Dad get back to the family, this kid uses his base ""network"" to get access to imagery, enemy air defense data, and two F16s carrying a B52's worth of ordinance.  All of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents, no less.  (If only strike planning was this easy.)  Of course, the kid has flown training missions with his dad, and has a boatload of simulator time, so he's a natural to fly the mission.  He convinces Gosset to go along with him, and his two-ship is on the way.  The flying scenes are nothing spectacular, with obviously Israeli F16s playing the good guys, and Kfirs (modified Mirages) acting as MiGs.  Cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer; I'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft.  These are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit, flight, and combat models.  Anyway, lots of explosions on the way in, Lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure.  He manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land (!) and pick him up.  More silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground, taxi's out and takesoff.  He kills the bad guy and heads home to find Lou punched out and was rescued.  Rather than the prison sentence for espionage, and theft of government property that Lou, the kid, his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should've got, he gets his slot at the Air Force Academy.  The end.Overall, I guess Lou's performance was fairly good, but everyone else performed at the grade-B level this flick is.  Note especially a very young Shawnee Smith as one of the kid's buds.  Worth seeing for laughs, and as a film version of a kid's pilot fantasy."	0
I remember putting Season 9 as the worst season of Friends in my book, but it's not as bad as I remembered. Some episodes are actually incredibly funny. The faux pas was when they started to have Aisha Tyler guess star as Charlie, and have her come between Joey and Ross. Also, the whole story line with Rachel's infatuation for Joey could've been better executed, or shouldn't have been there at all. It got bad towards the end, but I'm not disappointed. The stuff leadings towards it was classic Friends	1
This could have been one of the best films of the 80's. All of the components are there. Ford gives the best acting of his career. The production is elegant and holds up as often breathtaking even by today's standards. Two things however really bring this movie down. The major negative here I believe is Polanski's insistence on starring Emmanuelle Seigner. This is one of the sexiest women I have ever seen grace a film, but it is the understatement of the year to say that she can't act at all. In fact, I think that she might have just about turned in the worst acting performance I have ever seen in this film and it totally destroys Ford's performance. When the film was over I thought about it and came to the conclusion that there is really two halves here. The first half is dynamite; the second with Seigner is a totally different beast, your average stupid kid thriller. Watch this film and dare contradict my statement here. Get beyond her obvious good looks and tell me she just was not meant for this part. It's so bad that  Ford fades into the background in any scene that she was also in.OK, the second negative in this film are these two agents that keep popping up. There is no explanation ever given as to how they knew where Ford and Seigner would be time and time again. It really ruins what could have been a very nicely done and subtle plot. They were never needed and muddle an otherwise great story.I am really kind of mad with Polanski here. He destroyed what could have been one of the better films he has made. And this statement comes from one who worships the ground Polanski walks on.	0
"The American Dream is an appealing myth, no doubt. The idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it rich in America sounds great. The problem, as George Carlin put it, is that you have to be asleep to believe in it. So instead of representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for greed at all costs. And that is where ""Belly"" comes in, an ode to thug live and all the riches that come with it. This urban drama stars DMX (perpetually rapping), Nas, and Method Man and they would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies. The story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking drugs. When the plot does poke its head up I picked up on a criminal enterprise that moved shop from Queens to Omaha. Once there the cops get involved and people start getting shot. One couple tries to escape to Africa, but find it easier said than done. And Tommy (DMX) is sent on a mission to kill a minister. But really this film is about selling a lifestyle that doesn't even exist. Come on now, I've known drug dealers in my day, and they didn't live in large gaudy mansions . . . rap stars do. Rather they live in shacks or their parent's basement. If my response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is. The directing by Hype Williams isn't that bad. He is able to capture some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks. The lighting never seems quite right, but I'm gonna let that one slide. As a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in films I can hardly complain about their presence here. There people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being weighed down by bourgeois conventions. All that said this film still fully deserves the big no vote that I am going to give it. As the most nihilistic person I know I am surprised to report that this one really seemed lost. Any image they could flash on the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was used. The N and F words are used to comedic proportions. Their palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones and destroyed for no good reason. And then, on top of it all, we have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of us. Sorry man, but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks doesn't make you any less slimy than those Wall Street hacks. You're still a businessman. This film is not worth watching. Any social point that is made is made accidentally, and any filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love fest for all things gangsta. **1/4"	0

"I only gave this movie one star because it is against Amazon's rules to give it no stars. After hearing that this was a Christian movie, I could not wait to watch it. However, this movie has nothing in common with Christianity, quite the contrary, this is the most anti-Christian movie that I have ever seen; it promotes murder and other unsurpassable evil. The movie started out horribly and just continued to get worse. For instance, the beginning of the movie was shockingly pornographic. In a supposedly ""Christian"" movie I did not expect to be bombarded with this. After seeing this I did not expect that the movie could possibly get worse. However, I was greatly mistaken. Later in the movie the main character, who was remarkably unsympathetic, met several of her Christian co-workers who were talking about something they called ""the pearl dream."" Intrigued, the main character asked them what this dream was. Of course, they were unable to answer because it is complete nonsense. None the less, the main character continues to review what her co-workers have told her about Christianity over the years. As the movie plods along, generally confusing and boring the viewer, she comes to the decision to give up her sinful lifestyle and turn to God. When this event transpired I assumed, wrongly, that from this point forward the film would redeem its beginning and maybe even say something good about Christianity. This, however, is where the movie went form being merely bad to astoundingly  sacrilegious. Then, the main character and her young daughter set out for the desert. Due to a vague dream, they believed that this was God's will and that He would appear in the desert and take them to heaven, in other words ""rapture"" them. How they came to this assumption I was never quite sure. The movie often made ludicrous statements  which never made the slightest amount of sense. I became extremely weary trying to deduce what was happening. Nothing that took place in this movie was remotely Biblical nor was it well explained. As time passed our characters continued to sit in the desert, boring the viewer to tears. They begin to suspect that God was not coming to gather them to heaven and they started to despair. This is where the movie became intolerably anti-Christian; the mother took her daughter up to a mountain and asked her to kneel. She then forced her daughter to pray. After the prayer was concluded she took a gun from her dress and shot her crying daughter, supposedly to send her to heaven. She ""believes"" that she is doing God's will. Obviously, she was such an idiot that she failed to read that the Bible that strictly forbids murder. Afterwards, she is sent to prison, where we hope to see her suffer for her cruel, viscous, and insurmountably stupid act. As she is sitting in her cell, blaming God for the murder of her daughter, that she willingly committed (If she had half a brain cell she would have realized that she was doing Satan's will, not God's), she hears trumpets and the cell walls start to fall in. A few scenes pass, in which the ghost of her daughter returns and tries to redeem her faith. She, however, refuses. Then, she is taken to a dark room, that the viewer is supposed to believe is some supernatural place where judgment takes place, and asks if she loves God. She replies no, because she blames Him for her insanity. The film concludes with her standing stupidly in a dark room, that failed to represent eternity. Most of the aspects included in the film were never explained. Such as the significance of ""the pearl dream."" Nor was it explained why they believed that they needed to wait in the desert. How did they contrive this ridiculous idea from a vague, ambiguous, and utterly vapid dream anyway? None of these questions were ever answered. This caused the film to feel incomplete. The stories between scenes shifted so drastically that I suspected I had missed several important scenes. After checking my DVD I realized that I had not accidentally skipped crucial scenes, because their were none. This film was deliberately ambiguous and vapid. Also, the special effects, cinematography, and acting were about as good as a preschool play. None of the actors put any emotion into their roles. They recited their lines like drugged zombies; I suppose even they realized it was complete rubbish and decided not to put much effort into it. To state the obvious, this film is a disgrace! Obviously, it is not Biblically based. It does NOT represent Christian philosophy which is to love others, not to wander around aimlessly in the desert acting like a fool. Nor do Christians promote murder, as this film implied. This movie has as much religious value as Night of the Blind Nazi Zombies. I am ashamed to see that such a complete travesty is labeled a Christian film. This film is extremely anti-Christian; its main objective is to give the world the false impression that fundamentalist Christians are brainwashed and are incapable of sane thoughts. This is not true, and yes, I can prove it. All the proof that you need is contained in the Bible. If you stop hardening your heart and truly listen with an open mind then you cannot help but to see Jesus loving message for the world. He does not desire to bring misery to the world, but happiness and love. The reason that there is misery in the world is because people, like those who made this film, disobey God. If we followed His loving rules then we would not suffer. I do not write this rather long review out of hatred, as I am sure many will accuse me of. I write this to warn people what this movie is really about. It is not a true Christian movie like the Left Behind's and The Passion of the Christ.  And, yes I am aware that I will be bombarded by a slough of negative votes. However, I do not even faintly care. My beliefs, as a fundamentalist Christian and my love of God  is more important to me than a  number on a page.Also, I was shocked to read the other reviews on this forum, especially the one from the Wiccan woman who said that she wished to see Christians thrown to the lions as they were in the time of the Romans. I have seen a lot of hatred in my life but her review was by far the worst I have ever see. Christians love the world and those in it, we do not tell non-Christians about Christ to imply that we are ""holier than thou"" because we are not. All are equal under God's eyes. We are all sinners and the only way to attain redemption is to accept God's undeserved grace. We tell other people about God's undeserved love because we want to save them and see them living in eternal joy in Heaven. We do not rejoice to see people unsaved, we tell them about their condition because we want to see them saved. In other words, we tell people because we love them. Also, for those of you who accuse Christians of having a hatred of the world, why do you spew hatred in everything you say toward Christians? Aren't you displaying the hatred that you claim you abhor?In conclusion, this is the worst movie ever made. It is anti-Christian, immensely sacrilegious, poorly acted, poorly written, vapid, mind numbingly dull, disjointed, tortuously long, etc. In short, this film is an abomination. It is massively offensive to Christians and is a massive misrepresentation of Christian values. Also, the acting is abysmal and the story line hopelessly confusing. If you wish to watch a film that accurately portrays Christian values then I recommend watch ""The Passion of the Christ"" or the Left Behind movies.  I hope that this review will help you; it was written with love and concern. I shall keep you in my prayers. Have a wonderful new year.In Christ,RavenovaAlso recommended:  The Left Behind and the Ravenloft book Series"	0
Ok, first of all Oct Fri the 13th I FINALLY saw this movie in 3D, sigh I can die happy! Ok this one is really pretty awesome. Chris plays a great leading girl (the only F-13 leadI didnt want to see with an axe in her skull). The other characters are pretty harmless too. Wev'e got bikers (snort), pothead hippies, a fro'd chubster and a dude who can walks on his hands better than he can act. Plus this came out in the early 80's so the ratings board didnt demolish all the awesome gore scenes. I give this one a high-5! Cool deaths, funny scenes and aside from Chris's sherbert pants, some decent 80's fashion too. Yo Debbie, I want your bikini, too cuuute.	1

"Flight from death is a ""must see"" documentary. I saw it three times since i've received the DVD last week and each time i discover new aspects. Images are beautiful and the commentary (narrated by Gabriel Byrne) is just outstanding. Before seeing it, i was a little bit anxious to see how they can translate in a documentary the rather complex thought of Ernest Becker. As a reader of Becker's books for many years i can tell that Patrick Sean and Greg Bennick had done a fantastic job. Each important parts of Becker's understanding of the impact of death anxiety on human behavior are explored and very well explained. I understand now why this documentary won seven prizes. Please do not hesitate to buy this DVD you won't regret it! "	1
Whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people.  But all I see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around (few of them seem to have jobs) and party all day.

Overall, I have always enjoyed Robin William and Billy Crystal's performance in many other movies, but I must admit  to my surprise that it wasn't making me laughing on the floor as I usually do. The script was boring and the plot was downright disppointing. Didn't like the ending. It was like a stupid wild goose chase for both of them and end up accepting that the mother of the son lied to them.  Which is really a bad example for younger audience to see this and thinking it's normal for mothers to lie.  I hope someday to see both Robin and Billy to act together in another movie in the near future and hopefully better script than this one	0
"Leary is a hack. He wasn't ""influenced"" by Bill Hicks, he STOLE material. That makes him a hack. How can you Leary fans argue with the definition of the word hack? Take it up with Webster's Dictionary. The exact bits Leary stole are described in the book AMERICAN SCREAM on pages 201-202. Bill Hicks was incensed when he heard Leary's tape. On behalf of Bill's memory, give credit to the original. "	0
English humor is famous for it's eccentricities but with the exception of selected Monty Python you need the English pedigree to really like it. The Young ones pick up where Monty left off. Outrageous, yet real, there is a plot line but it doesn't get in the way. It's a shame there weren't more episodes made....	1
Why on earth am I giving this movie five stars?  Its plot is minimal.  The script has words and phrases I've never heard, and I'm not sure were ever really used in the real world.  And to top that off, it's more than a little unbelievable.However, despite all of the possible downsides, I really enjoyed it.  Honestly, I'm normally not into these kinds of films, but it was just good fun.  The humor wasn't disgusting and gross.  The chemistry between the actors made the on screen relationships believable (even if I don't ever buy the whole love at first sight scenario), and there wasn't some great moral constantly being shoved down my throat.All in all, it was just a fun movie to watch, and it's been a long time since a movie simply put a smile on my face	1
"They spend the first half of this movie saying how great the Ultimate Warrior was.  The journey is awesome!  Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they address this?  This ""docu"" is more slanted than ""Fahrenheitt 911"" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it. It just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking."	0
"Scratching deeper beyond the surface one can find RETURN OF THE SEVEN to be significantly different from its predecessor, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. It is much more than a thematically framed sequel which it can easily be mistaken for. RETURN OF THE SEVEN is a dark film and it does not offer the hope of a truly optimistic future for any of its characters. In this respect it is a complete inversion of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. Through their catharsis in the original we saw an attempt at redemption through an act of nobility on the part of the seven. They truly were noble and I believe were redeemed for their transgressions as gunmen. Some thought they could start their lives over again but inevitably they could not. That film had to end as it did with the seven ultimately all committed to their singular code of ethics and morality in an emotionally charged finale. In this film there is very little emotion on the surface. Instead director Burt Kennedy gives us a thought provoking study into the human psyche and the very nature of defeatism of the human spirit. In this film there are no pretensions on the part of the seven. For most of them this is just another gun job. There are no higher aspirations that they are cognizant of. If it were not this job, it would be the next. To tell his story Burt Kennedy focuses almost entirely on the character of Chris the leader, perfectly portrayed again by Yul Brynner. This is not really a tale of the seven. Instead Kennedy uses Brynner with all his aplomb and apparent stoicism to curiously examine and probe the motivations of the other six, Lorca the villain (pompously played by Mexican director Emilio Fernandez) and several other key characters. In effect Kennedy takes what was apparently a happy or satisfactory ending from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and asks what if. What if 10 years later the remaining characters are not so contented as prior events led us to believe they would be? Would friends be willing go up against innumerable odds? Would strangers once again sign on to go up against those same innumerable odds? Do the strong still have to help the weak? And who really are the strong and the weak? When 50 or more marauding vaqueros whisk away Chico (Julian Mateos) and other Mexican farmers from surrounding villages Chris and Vin (Robert Fuller) agree to come to his aid.  However it is Chris alone that recruits the members of the ""seven"" this time out. Kennedy singularly endows Chris a sense of morality and level headedness in this film that comes from his wisdom and manner of nobility. In effect this is Brynner's film all the way. Just as John Sturges' directorial style was so smooth that his own storytelling glossed right over the depth and complexity of his own work so is Burt Kennedy's. However, Kennedy is challenged with a very dark and brooding tale to tell. Where Sturges' THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN could easily have been taken on a purely action film level and still been successful, Kennedy does not have that luxury. Kennedy has to deliver an action film built on previous events and he also has to approach the story from a different perspective to remain fresh yet keep it thematically to the concept of the original ""Seven."" Not an easy task! If the viewer does not look deeply into this film it may just appear as a well produced `dud.' However, I believe Kennedy succeeds far beyond expectations the more times I view this film. Again it comes back to Brynner. He makes members of the seven (Vin, Chico and Colbee) all come to realizations about themselves with his subtle yet profound dialogue.  He gives Riker and Luis a chance at redemption even though both men come from total opposites of the spectrum. He helps the failed priest rise from his failures ""at least as far as his knees."" Chris even gives Lorca, the villain a chance to ride out because when Chris was younger he gave him the same chance. However, Chris refuses to let Lorca now bathe his personal grief as an ineffectual father ""in other men's blood."" Yet even Lorca is literally redeemed by the end of the film. When Petra tells Chris that the farmers will never forget them he simply replies, ""That's all a man can ask."" That is the mystique and legacy of the ""seven."" Even the character of Chris is endowed with human flaws. He recklessly took on the young Manuel rounding out the seven ""for luck"" with tragic results and we see Brynner deeply grieved on the screen. This is a film of hard lessons learned. Technically this is a well-made film. The cinematography is full of crane, dolly and tracking shots, which gives it both perspective and movement. Bernstein's score is full and lush and this is the single cohesive element that keeps the seven together. The set designs are dark, grim and rustic giving the film a pensive psychological depth. The payoff for Brynner and the viewer comes in the final shot. Looking at the farmers rebuilding the village he comments, ""I'll be damned."" Vin looks at him and responds, ""I doubt that. I doubt that very much.""  They both ride off. They just don't make heroes like that any more"	1
" If you believe in the Devil, and I mean *really* believe in the devil, I can't think of one good reason why you'd want to summon the Devil into this world. At worst, he's purported to be the father of lies, and one of the fallen angels. This means that anything he tells you is suspect, anything he gives you is suspect, and he probably has the power to make you believe in him. Yikes. Not a safe trip. Not a terribly sane trip, for that matter.Yet that is precisely what Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) desired. He had one copy of ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadow"", and there were three extant. One or all of these books is a forgery, and one or all holds the secret to summoning Satan. He hires Corso (played a bit too understated by Johnny Depp) to research the other texts.The movie is based on the novel ""The Club Dumas"" by Arturo Perez Reverte, which I favorably reviewed.I can't give a similar review to The Ninth Gate for a number of reasons. First, Depp's portrayal of Corso was one dimensional, and Corso was a multi-dimensional character. Whether that's the filmmaker's fault or Depp's I don't know, but Depp's Corso was a dreadful bore.A mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his, demonstrating supernatural abilities. We are never given ample evidence as to why she might have had an interest in helping Corso, or in what her abilities might have been (never mind her identity). Yet since this is a character from the book, I know why she was there, I have a pretty good idea who she was (and good job to the author on how he handled that!) and her character's interests and abilities could have been better communicated, with very little difficulty.Also, in a rather silly departure from the book (departures are fine...I'm not being a book snob), they substitute an average sized platinum-blonde haired black male for a character in the book who was tall, white, and physically imposing. There's nothing that irritates me more than a ""quota substitute"". I don't think this particular sub had any speaking lines, which makes it that much more of an insult.I love intelligent thrillers. (I didn't care for The Da Vinci Code.) This was a thriller that spent time in libraries, that examined woodcuttings drawn, perhaps, by Lucifer himself - yet I wasn't engaged.In 1999, when the film was released, I couldn't sit through it. After reading The Club Dumas and then discovering that there was a connection between the two, I approached the film again, hoping that understanding where the book was coming from would help. It did not. In fact, it raised more questions.I would give this movie 2.5 stars and round it up to 3; however, I'm reviewing the DVD and the DVD gets a big spanking for not having subtitles. There's no excuse, in this day and age, for a mainstream DVD not to offer subtitles."	0
"The musical was a virtual voyage back to my childhood when I saw it for the first time. My husband is no ""square"" and he enjoyed it all. Seniors would love to see it again.  The film was obviously preserved well and the color was enriched beautifully for this dvd"	1
This is a great movie, especially if you like &quot;Dancehall Queen&quot;. Paul Campbell does a great job as Capone and Carl Bradshaw is excellent as usual as the crime boss. While the story is somewhat generic it is still well worth watching	1

"I read the various reviews about the movie ""The Hunter"".  I was surprised at the extremeties in preference.  Much like owning a Fiero,  . . . . which I do.The movie, as is the Fiero, is overall slower than most of McQueen's.  However, he still pulls it off, showing his great acting ability.  When you take the character, ""Papa"" Thorson,  he was a different breed in the wrong time era.  Who else, but McQueen could make him so realistic?I haven't seen the movie in several years. I have been wanting a copy to add to my library.  I intend to do that today.Oh yeah, the relationship between the movie and the Fiero?  I have found that there are those that either dearly love it or wish they had never laid eyes on it.  I loved ""The Hunter"" and I love my Fiero.  For those of you who don't understand, . . . ""sorry""!  Steve McQuen displayed more of his talent, even while ill.   God bless you, Steve and thank you for the entertainment you gave us"	1
"Saw the knock-off series ""Jeremiah"" when it was the classic Star Trek episode ""Miri"", in which all the adults past puberty were killed by a virus originally meant to prolong life.  Also saw it as the Canadian TV series ""The Tribe"", in which all the adults are killed by some sort of plague.  Also read it in ""The Kindling"", by Jennifer Armstrong, a novel in which teenagers must care for the younger kids after a virus wipes out their memories and kills all adults.  I laughed when the Amazon reviewer called the premise of ""Jeremiah"" ""intriguing"".  Well, the other works don't have Luke Perry or pretty F/X.  Maybe that's the ""intriguing"" part of this latest adaptation of one of the most overused themes in Science Fiction."	0
"""St. Elmo's Fire"" is one of those movies that could have been better, should have been better and yet, it just wasn't.It featured an ensemble cast of THE young and hot stars of the 1980s, the so-called Brat Pack (well, everyone but Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, who were spared this misstep).  Maybe this was supposed to be ""The Breakfast Club - - After College"", but while ""The Breakfast Club"" had characters, even stereotypical characters, that you could relate to, there is absolutely no one, with the exception of Emilio Estevez' character, that you care enough about to relate to in this film.The setting is not the John Hughes teen friendly Illinois, but Georgetown, where our bunch of Brat Packers have supposedly graduated from college.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, RIGHT.  Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is, Nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that Sheedy, in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that.  Andrew McCarthy is their mutual friend who knows what Nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for Sheedy (or maybe it's just the pearls?)  Emilio Estevez is a future attorney, working as a waiter/server and suffering a serious crush on Andie MacDowell.  Mare Winningham is a dowdy, trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity, working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her.  She instead fantasizes about Rob Lowe, who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band, who has dropped out of school, married a white trash-y looking groupie, had a child with her and has now separated from her, and taking up with other groupies.  Demi Moore is the wild chick who works in international banking, has a serious coke problem, stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of Billy Idol.  Sounds promising, huh?  Well, in what is an early portend of the ""Melrose Place"" to come, Sheedy finds out what a dog Nelson is, dumps his ass, immediately jumps into bed with McCarthy, who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job; Estevez, after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there, travels to the snowy mountains to track down MacDowell and profess his love to her.  He finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed, he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home.  Lowe, in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere, takes Winningham's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus.  Moore, after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother, has all her furnishings repossessed, loses her job and freaks out.Not exactly ""The Breakfast Club"".  The real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves.  With the exception of Estevez' character, they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped.  Their every action, every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional.  Their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that.Winningham's character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed Lowe around like a sick puppy, knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was.  And yet, she still gave her virginity to him.  Maybe if Winningham wasn't so bright, or she was a college freshman, it would be understandable.  But she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent.Lowe really had little to do with his role.  Maybe if he had played the role Nelson had - - as the roving Lothario, with Sheedy waiting at home, it might have gone over better.  With his too-pretty looks, it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him.  Nelson just doesn't seem comfortable and doesn't pull it off - -but maybe Nelson might have been better suited for the sax player.Moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems, mirroring her character - - but was later rehired.While the title song later become a minor hit, ""St. Elmo's Fire"" itself missed the mark.

Martin Short is priceless in this movie - I enjoyed every minute. 	1
"In an attempt to meet more girls, I took French many, many years ago when I was still in junior high school (middle school to you young 'uns). In class, my French teacher treated us to a film screening of Jean Cocteau's LA BELLE ET LA BETE (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST). Truthfully, back then, I didn't think much of it other than being something too ""arty."" But, over the past two decades, I've seen this film a number of times and now have a decidedly higher opinion of it. LA BELLE ET LA BETE is a seriously important movie and a groundbreaking entry into the world of cinema. It's certainly Cocteau's masterpiece. Without a doubt, it provided the direct inspiration for Disney's Oscar-nominated version, as well as greatly influencing CBS's 1987 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST television series.Jean Cocteau took Madame Leprince de Beaumont's classic story, adapted it, and put his own stamp on it. Cocteau's artistic vision is dazzling to behold. The viewer is treated to a delectable visual feast replete with disturbingly aware statues, ghostly arms jutting out of walls to clutch  candles, vocal household objects, jewelry which turns to rubbish, etc. But nicely juxtaposed with the imaginative, surrealistic trappings are the more mundane sequences revolving around Belle's family, which serve to somewhat ground the fairy tale to a more reality-based semblance.      This atmospheric film was given an enormous lift by the very wonderful performances of the two leads, Josette Day and Jean Marais. Josette Day, as Belle, her most luminous role, personified beauty, grace, and class. Jean Marais, on the other hand, made women and young girls swoon in his dual roles as the handsome scoundrel Avenant and the tortured but gentle-hearted Beast. In fact, Marais portrayed the fearsome Beast in such a sympathetic and romantic light that, in the end, when the hirsute and awful monster was transformed into the handsome prince, Cocteau and Marais actually received many letters of complaint. The women much preferred their kindly Beast. ************************************************************The Criterion Collection's high-definition, crystal clear digital transfer is awesome to experience, lending a lushness and clarity that was lacking in the older, grainier copies. This film is also well-stocked with special features: - 2 audio commentaries - a Philip Glass opera soundtrack option - ""Screening at the Majestic"" -  a 1995 documentary featuring interviews with the cast and crew - Interview with the film's Director of Photography Henri Alekan - ""Secret Professionels: Tete a Tete"" (Professional Secrets: Face to Face) -  the title of a French television show, of which particular 1965 episode showcases makeup artist Hagop Arakelian, who worked on LA BELLE ET LA BETE  - the original trailer - the restoration trailer - Film Restoration segment - Stills Gallery- a booklet which includes Jean Cocteau's notes on the film and a reprinted translation of Madame Leprince de Beaumont's original fable.

I love this film, beautifully simple and human. The characters are real; flawed yet somehow you find sympathy for them- just like your own family. I've rented at least fifteen times, and I never get bored of it. It's great any time of year, but fantastic for the holidays	1
I like Japanese films, and really wanted to like this one. However I must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot. Now I have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day. If that is true I might give it a higher rating. As of now however, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense	0

When I 1st watched Requiem From The Darkness I had high hopes for an anime show I heard that could actually by scary. To my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime. This show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people. The strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing. Also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered. This show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each/husband killing wife after wife/a man who enjoys murder/and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other. I recommend this show to no one and I believe Geneon has made a mistake licensing it. If you don't heed my review then you have wasted your money on a DVD not worth a penny (I wouldn't take it for free)	0
The BBC created the perfect cast in this terrific film. Watching it is like entering into a more pleasant world than the one that exists today. It is lavishly adorned with beautiful costume and sets. The latest adaptation is an insult to the major players in the BBC version. Highly recommend to those who love Jane Austin and her works	1

I had heard about this flick being talked about as the Chinese Charlie's Angels.  It took me a while but I finally popped it in.  WOW, this has to be on of the coolest movies  I have seen in a while.  I was expecting a chick flick but maybe that is why I liked it so much.  The story is about these 2 women who have kind of a stupid backround story but what they do now is assasinate people for a living.  Sweet!  I am not going to lie, I wasn't paying attention to the story what so ever the first time i saw this because of how hot these women are.  Add in a super hot cop who wants to take them down, and you have yourself one of the funnest movie ever.  All of these girls know martial arts, or at least they can put their legs up really high and director Corey Yuen puts in some of the best wirework I have seen.  This movie certainly isn't going to win any awards for it's high amount of cheese injected in the plot but it is a movie that I wish I could fill my room with about 100 diffrerent screen shot posters.  So on top of this being an amazingly fun movie, Yasuaki Kurata shows up for the finale!!!!!!!  Corey Yuen goes all out with this one and puts together truly one of the best screen battles of all time that will rival any old school kung fu movie.  If you have seen some of Coery's 80's stuff like Yes Madam or even the newer Fong Sai Yuk then get ready to be taken back some years when Corey did some of the best action sequences in the history of cinema(Example:Ninja in the Dragon's Den).  Kurata plays a great character in my favorite movie ever, Legend of a Fighter which was made in 1981.  Well at 56 years old he looks just as good!!!!  I was so amazed by this movie I have watched it 3 nights in a row and I will continue this routine for a while:)The picture quality on the Columbia Tristar version is perfect and has pretty well written subtitles.  Also good 5.1 sound, cantonese track, the original mandarin track, and a horrible English dub. 	1
The movies and stories are classic westerns, the quality is horrible, these are not remastered.  It looks like they found the oldest copy of the film and transfered it to DVD.  If I didn't like the actual movies, I would not buy knowing the quality	0
"  Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by  GM's unhealthy cost structure. The  company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomesthe reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney  UAW sponsored lies to  shift attention away from the primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it.  Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a ""documentary."""	0
I really enjoyed the first urban legends movie, but this one I was not impress by at all.  I wish I would have taken these reviews more seriously that I read before buying this dvd.  This was an awful cheapo urban legends movie.  Theres nothing here to come close of where the first urban legends was.  I see now theres a third urban legends movie out, im not sure if that ones good or bad, like this one.  If you have a couple of bucks to blow, go ahead and get this one.  If you seriously want a good atleast kinda scary movie, look else where.P.S. No wonder this dvd is only $9.00 bucks	0
"I saw this movie years ago, but didn't remember much about it, except some of the songs, and the basic story.  I also saw ""Nights of Cabiria"", from which the story was taken. I love musicals, and I think Shirley MacLaine is very talented.  She is very sweet as Charity Hope Valentine, and one can't help wanting a happy ending for her.  So why did I think this movie was awful? First of all, some of the dialogue was so repetitious it became irritating-- how many times can you listen to Charity say ""Fickle finger of fate"" over and over without wanting to hit the mute button?  Also, some of the scenes went on and on and on-- especially the elevator scene.  And-- the intermission was totally unnecessary. But the worst disappointment for me was the musical numbers. I didn't like any of them--- they were so far over the top as to be silly.  Bob Fosse must have thrown everything into them that he could--- instead of letting the dancers and the songs carry the numbers, he had so much busyness in all of them-- too many people, costumes that didn't fit the story, silly moves-- and they all went past the point of enjoyment.  I fast forwarded thrua couple of them just to get them over with.  I have never done that before with any movie. This could have been so much better-- the story was good, the charactors were good-- but the whole thing should have been toned down. The movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if there had been some trimming. It was entirely too long.   Also--- all that stop action-- what was that all about? I know, I know-- it was to show the progress of the story, but it was a distraction.I didn't like the movie and was glad when it was over."	0

With season 4 the series starts to slide a little. I don't think the show is weaker,it's just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already? Look, I love the Godfather one and two,but three is just not as good. The total time it takes to watch the first two Godfather films is a little over 5 hours! That won't even get you through season one of the Sopranos. I hope I speak for everyone out there when I say that as good as the Sopranos is, it will never come closed to the Godfather movies. So I guess it is just starting to get old. I will certainly be watching the finale episodes, I just hope it isn't too big a let down. For those who are interested the DVD set has great transfers, but few interesting extras	1
I watched this dvd in one of my classes and it left me feeling hoplessly hopeless!I really dont know what to think about the whole presentation. The presence of Chomsky makes it look reputable but who knows, he might have been taken out of context although it seemed not. If what they claim about corporations is true, then we are getting ready to implode in one way or another.I'll keep away from political lines and just suggest that you watch it and decide...I had given it a rating of 3 but just changed it to 4. The material is more plausible than otherwise	1
Let me start by saying that i love this movie and  love fulci.This was the first fulci flick i seen and when i first watched it i thought it was a little overrated,it was only after i watched the majority of his other movies that i really learned to appreciate it.(Let me explain.)this was the one of his movies that failed to shock me.When i watched the regurgitation of giblets scene from 'city' i was shocked.When i watched the nipple scene in 'ripper' i was shocked.Watching this again i realize its probably the best done of all his movies but definetely not his goriest and the story isnt really the greatest(im sorry).The only reason i write this review is probably because the poor reviews of the two other two movies ive mentioned,which honestly i enjoyed more.Zombie is a great movie but nowhere near his best or goriest.(Isnt that why we watch fulci flicks?	1
These are great films and the set is lovely. But boo to Criterion anyhow for not sticking up for Cassavetes scholar Ray Carney, whose name was removed from the set after months of work because of his feud with Cassavetes' widow Gena Rowlands. Buy the DVD set, anyhow, you must, but go to the Cassavetes pages, find Carney's links, and read his account of the troubles he's had, trying to preserve and expose people to rare cuts of FACES and SHADOWS he himself tracked down... Sorry to take sides -- Gena Rowlands probably has her own justifications for feeling as she does -- but I greatly admire Carney's contributions to keeping Cassavetes' memory alive and exposing people to his films; he put an amazing amount of work into CASSAVETES ON CASSAVETES, too. It sucks that he kind of got stiffed here. 	0
They don't make films like this today.  It's a scathing, smart, funny, and thought-provoking look at TV news.  But more importantly, it's a great film about complicated people and their relationships	1
"I'm sorry, but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film ""Dick."" ""Dick"" is funny, this is not. I'm sorry, but Dustin Hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like Kirsten Dunst (or that level of indefatigable cuteness).Just go rent ""Dick"" instead. You'll thank me, yourself, and those fine ladies who saved our country"	0

It is almost ashame that North Amercian culture needs Bill Maher.After all, shouldn't honest yet entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available then it currently is? On Victory Begins At Home, Maher creates entertainment by basically speaking his mind.Maher's central premise that the War On Terrorism can be aided by what people do in the United States really is almost a common sense arguement. Yet Maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how he presents it, the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy that few comedians can match. Maher does this by not pretending he isn't politically opinated, in fact that is what bases his comedy completely on, the rarity of straight-forward unabashed opinion.On Victory Begins At Home he is more Democrat then Republican, but he openly sides with neither. Instead, he rails at all presenting himself as a full person, neither liberal nor conservative, right-wing or left-wing.The end result is an engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered. There is no spin here, what Maher realizes is that no spin is funny in a world full of it. With all the spin that is normally doled out by the news media, political columnists and special interest groups, know wonder we need him so much.	1
"As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who ""ruined"" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can see"	0
It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie	0
I saw this movie on TV years ago and loved it.  I thought the storyline was terrific.  There's plenty of action, family situations, love interest, but, mostly, this movie engages you -- it forces you to care about the characters.  It's a great movie.  Three words: keep tissues handy	1
I saw this show on Logo. Boy I loved it. I wish I was there	1
i just wanted to say this is a great workout. i love the eastern dance styles. i have just written a long review of honey's bollywood workout,and people were saying the same things, too fast etc...but indian dance is taught by imitation, and is very expressive facially and bodily(especially the classical dances) and open to improv. bollywood and bhangra are an extension of classical. most don't realize eastern dance is learned and practiced in a vigorous manner imitating, learning, and memorizing from the beginning. the teachers of the classical and indian dances do not like to break up the steps and movement or slow them unless they are so, because you lose the inspiration and the feeling of whatever you may be portraying. so have fun with this, it's awesome and leaves room for your own interpretation of things as mentioned. and it really wears you out. plus everyone looks great dancing and celebrating the movement and abilities of the body no matter the dance form! but i find eastern to be the most passionate, feminine, beautiful, and divine. have fun	1
This film, like most of his early work, is for Hitchcock aficionados only. I am an admirer of Hitchcock and also enjoy old British films, but I still found this movie tough going, not least because of the 110 mins running  time. The picture quality of this Laserlight DVD is not perfect, but it is  perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you'd expect for the  price. The musical score is also okay, but nothing to write home about.  Laserlight do however pose a mystery that Hitch himself would have been  proud of. This DVD has no commentary, no documentary and no trailer, not  even one of those awful Tony Curtis intros. So why do Laserlight describe  this DVD as a 'Special Edition' 	0
My wife really likes Martin. After listening to this concert I must say it is indeed a very good live presentation	1
"Brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them.  This is a blatant effort to wrench young children's emotions and therefore their perspectives  about the eeeevil effects of ""global warming"" by engaging their sympathies.  The only plot is brainwashing, using penguins as the straw man.  The penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them.  As a responsible parent, I would avoid this entirely."	0
Does anyone know if there is a real PG-13 version of this film?  I've been told it came out as a PG-13 and then was changed to an R film.  Pretty strange way to deal with a science fiction film that kids would want to see..	0

I was introduced to the Matthew Shepard story by MTV's dramatic presentation of Matthew's last days in Laramie. With that as my background, I entered The Laramie Project with curiosity regarding the reactions of Laramie's townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention. Matthew was a human being, undeserving of the cruel torture that led to his death. Shameless hatred was definitely reflected by several Laramie residents, but not everyone shared that view. That fact was refreshing. The law enforcement officer who freed Matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly sympathetic. Her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not revealed, but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a horrific crime were apparent. Other Laramie residents were just as horrified. The so-called clergyman who brazenly expressed a heartless sentiment to one of the interviewers was expected, but equally unnerving. This film, though actors portrayed the townspeople interviewed, has the feel of a documentary. Knowing that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times. But the presentation was enlightening. The film addressed the fact that hate crimes are just that - crimes. No matter what a person's viewpoint, lifestyle or background, no one has a right to take on the position of punisher. Humans are not animals. Or, at least they shouldn't act like them. The Laramie Project exposes the heart of many people after the Matthew Shepard murder. It is worth the watch	1
"To Be or Not To Be is a comedy set during WWII. Although it makes light of a tense time in history, it manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the viewer at ease. The story revolves around two actors in Poland, Maria and Joseph Tura. Joseph (Jack Benny) specializes in overplaying Hamlet and Maria (Carole Lombard) specializes in seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins his ""To be or not to be"" speech. The man she seduces is a soldier who draws her into a dangerous spy situation. Although she is working for the Allies, a Nazi leader attempts to make her a spy for his cause. Madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get them out of the mess.The film is very funny thanks to the brilliant dialogue and acting. It is a real shame that Carole Lombard died after this film was made in a plane crash; she proves to be a very beautiful and talented comedienne."	1
Jack Nicholson in this shameless attempt at comedy plays a dog trainer of all professions who gets involved with an oprea singer who is caught up in the underworld of crime. Critcally embarssing to Nicohlson's carrer but jack has done much better to cover this mistake. A minor film with good talent gone to waste, a film way below par considering the re-teaming of director Bob Rafelson &amp; Nicholson from &quot;FIVE EASY PIECES&quot	0
"With the phenomenal success of ""The Poseidon Adventure"", the first disaster movie of its kind, the sequel was sure to be a hit.  Not so.  A plot containing two rival treasure salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great.  Having a leading lady (Sally Fields) fresh from an Oscar win and a few veteran actors (Michael Caine, Karl Malden), might also sound promising.  Unfortunately, the magic of the set production of the original is not even close.  Instead of upside ballrooms, barber shops, kitchens and bathrooms, the audience is presented with storage rooms simply full of boxes.  The rest of the cast is comprised of television actors, who are as wooden as the script.  There's no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly ridiculous, you won't even laugh in disbelief.  Irwin Allen had gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising sequel.  Considering the original, that's a terrible shame"	0
By the title I would be led to believe that there is more than one George story. There is one George and a few others, one of which scares my 2 1/2 year old. I thought the stories would be animated. However, some (including George) are pictures from a story book. We love to read books, but videos should be more than photos of a story book. Would not recommend this	0
"I'm not sure why I never watched ""Ghost"" before until last night.  For some reason, I didn't pay much heed to it when it was first released and never thought it was worth watching on TV.  I'm glad I gave it a chance because this is a GOOD movie.  What makes it good is its' skillful mixture of suspense, romance, comedy, and the supernatural.  That would seem to be too much to tackle for one movie but we get it all in the right balance.  I was drawn rather quickly into the movie and got to where I couldn't wait to see what was coming next.  There were a few ""convenient"" capabilities that these ghosts had that were necessary for the story to work.  I'm a rather pragmatic person but, by the time these things came up, I was so caught up in the story that I WANTED these things to be possible.  Obviously, the writer and director deserve accolades for their work and the actors do as well.  I wanted to make note of the quality of acting because it was probably the cast that left me uninterested in watching ""Ghost"".  I was prepared to be unimpressed in particular with Whoopie Goldberg so I want to confess that I thought her Best Supporting Actress Oscar was well-deserved.  I figure that I was one of the last persons in America to see ""Ghost"" but if there are others of you out there who still haven't seen it, give it a look; it's well worth it"	1
"I LOVED ""Never Cry Wolf""!!!  I saw it years ago on video, but can only imagine the DVD is as good or better.  I was disappointed to see that it was listed with 'The Bear' to buy together....  I love Anthony Hopkins, and the Bear was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen.  Don't let the pairing with 'The Bear' scare you off.  ""Never Cry Wolf"" is excellent!Sorry Tony :-)  Okay, I just realized that 'The Edge' was the one with Anthony Hopkins... my apologies to the Bear!   Anyway, get ""Never Cry Wolf""!  You won't be disappointed!!"	1
Solar Flow is a fine dvd, but should not be marketed as something separate from Yoga Shakti.  There are no new sequences, just remixes of the Shakti sequences.

Leather Wing would only buy this if he ran out of toilet paper, because, you know, a dvd makes good toilet paper (maybe it's why he's so grumpy).I would suggest purchasing it and watching it.  Michael Moore may be more to the left than some, but god, hasn't anyone ever considered watching everything with a speculative eye?  It's less biased than the news is - he reports, you decide, and most of it is things that should have been covered by the news in some fashion, but weren't.Michael Moore is far more honest than the Republican talking heads (Rush, Coulter, Hannity).  Watch, enjoy, investigate further	1
"This series represents the second attempt to revive TZ, and is vastly inferior to its predecessor.  The series began with some built-in problems, particularly the choice of Forest Whitaker as host-narrator.  Mr. Whitaker is a fine actor, but a poor  choice to host the series, and he appears quite uncomfortable when introducing episodes, often walking around while delivering his opening lines.  After watching some of these episodes, one can understand Forest's discomfort; he probably regretted accepting the job.  Another major problem is that this series came out on UPN, which has never been (and never will be) a leader in quality programming.  Although there are some interesting story ideas, they usually fall flat in the end.  ""It's Still A Good Life"" is a noteworthy example.  Intended as a sequel to one of the best episodes of the original series, and featuring original cast members Cloris Leachman and Bill Mumy (with the addition of Mumy's daughter, Liliana), this episode gets off to a good start, but the plot abruptly takes a silly turn, leading to a rushed, nonsensical, and unsatisfying conclusion.  This sort of hackneyed plotting occurs throughout the series.  Talented actors simply cannot compensate for lousy writing.  This series resembles the original in name only, and even the worst of the mid-80's episodes is superior to this conglomeration of silly, poorly-written, lame stories.  The kindest thing that can be said for this set is that it is reasonably priced and nicely packaged.  Enjoy it for what it is, but, as Andy Taylor once told Gomer Pyle, ""Don't over-expect.""  "	0
"This film released in late 1984,is about a married man named Rob Salinger(the late Dudley Moore) who secretly marries another woman during his current marriage. Rob is a newspaper editor married to Micheline ""Micki"" Salinger(Ann Reinking),a judge. While secretly romancing Maude(Amy Irving),he proposes to her(Maude). Rob has babies by both women and in one of the last scenes,they(the women) both meet and converse about their respective simultaneous marriages. But Rob keeps both wives.

"Jack ""Deuce"" Cooper (Matt LeBlanc) is a minor league baseball pitcher who's got the goods, but no self-confidence. Instead of looking up Dr. Phil, the team manager decides that a simian teammate is just what strike-out Deuce needs for a boost. Enter Ed, a chimp who's got more talent in his elongated little finger than the whole team put together. Ed's antics, including scarfing down chocolate-covered bananas and pulling toupees off of bald heads, were all ""aped"" by men in monkey suits and animatronics. Unfunny slapstick makes this DVD a real strike-out.Staci Layne WilsonAuthor of Staci's Guide to Animal Movie"	0
"The Hand of Fear is not top-notch, all-time classic Who. Even producer Philip Hinchcliffe doesn't like it very much. The only reason it was likely selected for DVD release over such classics as The Seeds of Doom or Terror of the Autons is probably because it's Sarah Jane's farewell story. Many stories during the Hinchcliffe/Holmes years of Who, sometimes referred to as the ""golden age"" of Doctor Who, sometimes referred as the ""gothic horror period,"" were based on movies. The Seeds of Doom was based on The Day of the Triffids. Horror of Fang Rock was based on And Then There Were None. If not based on an actual film, many were ""inspired"" in general by the look and feel of the Hammer horror films. The Hand of Fear was inspired by The Hands of Dr. Orlac, the old horror film about the disembodied hand of a killer. The story starts out great, beginning with a fantastic in-joke. Rock quarries were VERY frequently used in the program as they were easily accessible and somewhat looked like alien planets. Here the Doctor and Sarah land in a rock quarry on earth, and Sarah thinks they're on an alien planet! After an accident with a detonation, Sarah finds Eldrad's hand, and starts saying she/he/it must live a lot. ""Eldrad must! live"" (high note on ""must""). She takes the hand to a nuclear power plant where it can start absorbing energy and regenerating. The story thus far is excellent, and Sarah Jane, possessed by Eldrad, is genuinely creepy, though why she's dressed as Andy Pandy I'll never know. Extremely effective is the scene were the power plant worker disappears with the hand into the core. Also extremely effective is Eldrad eerily searing through the metal door of the power plant's core, and then slowly emerging. The show goes downhill quick once Eldrad, Doctor and co. head to Eldrad's planet. Producer Hinchcliffe said this was a bad shift and that it lacked a certain punch. I agree. For some reason, once Eldrad is back on its home planet the story loses all its edge. Furthermore, Sarah's farewell seems entirely forced. The Hand of Fear, overall, is still good stuff though, and is well worth owning. It is one of the few episodes that contains the cool version of the Tardis interior. (Why they didn't stick with the awesome Jules Verne-ish interior I have no idea!)"	1
I have always been a fan of movies that mix special effect animation with live action and the Mask is no exception. I would also have to say that the Mask is one of a kind in terms of unique films. There are many good things about this film aside from the well written script and good acting but I think the one thing that shines the most about the Mask is the special effects and the humor that goes along with it. For those of you who don't know, a big portion of the effects and humor from this movie stem from the old Tex Avery cartoons such as droopy the dog and the lone wolf who lusts after the nightclub dancer in a red dress (this feature is shown in the bonus section of the dvd). These kind of cartoons were always my favorite growing up aside from looney tunes. Getting back on the subject, what I also found thrilling about the Mask is how well the dog Milo was trained to perform certain task. If you have seen this movie, you know what I'm talking about. The training of the dog is also shown in the bonus section of the dvd. The movie itself was a take-off of the comic series of the Mask. Though not quite as dark as the comics, the film itself managed to portray enough adult humor and semi-violence so that the Mask would not be deemed as a children's film hence the PG-13 rating. A big plus to the Mask was how Jim Carrey portrayed the different character traits of Stanley Ipkis and Stanley Ipkis wearing the mask. Another big plus about this movie is the main villain getting hold of the mask. And of course, who can dislike Ben Stein's typical character of a monotone man with sarcastic remarks? Oh, and Cameron Diaz is an absolute babe in this movie as well. As for the dvd, this re-release is an improvement from the previous. You get 5.1 surround sound along with a crisp widescreen picture. The added bonus features are also great and should be viewed to appreciate what was put in to making this movie	1
Saw this movie at a sneak preview as I could not wait for it to be released. Wonderful & awesome feel good movie. I bought the 2004 calendar and was anxious for the movie's release on DVD.

If your a fan of progressive rock, you probably already know how good this CD is. In my mind it is the single greatest CD of all time (followed closely by Operation Mindcrime, any of the great Pink Floyd and Rush records)My only complaint on this DVD, is the sound. I was at this show and the sound at the theater was great. Somewhere, it didn't transfer to the recording. It is not the worst thing I have ever heard, but it doesn't show the bands power live. Every other aspect of this DVD is well worth the price. I would not want to be with out it.	1
the film is pretty lightweight on a whole but it has a nice charm with a well known Hollywood cliche in film making.I applaud the effort.the chicks in this Film are Happening Babes Fo SHO.but there ain't much to the Film but it has some fun to it	0
This movie has the feel of a late-night monster fest hosted by Svengoolie or Elvira. I had no idea what this was about when I started watching it, but by the end, I wished I would have skipped it entirely. The story starts off well, with murders happening in an old factory by some mysterious monster (that you don't see at first). From there it goes downhill, it felt like a low-rent 'Pet Sematary'. I have never read the short story that this was based off of, but I'm sure that King made his scarier than this movie could ever be. The best acting in the movie comes from Brad Dourif, best known for his performance as Billy Bibbit in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and the voice of Chucky the killer doll from 'Child's Play', as an exterminator	0
Compared to Argento, I must say that Mario Bava is for me entirely overrated. He might be a pioneer, but as a stylist he is sadly lacking. His seventies work is more often than not tiresome and tawdry, even if you like horror films.Argento fans seeking out 'Shock' on the strength of Daria Nicolodi's starring role, music by two members of Goblin (under the nom-de-plume 'A.Libra)and Srgento's supposed giallio-based debt to Bava should buy 'Shock' with caution. Although it is an authentic slice of Eurohorror and better than the contemporary garbage horror Hollywood churns out, it is still a fairly dreary, dull, repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances.Finally, the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when compared to some of Jess Franco's rubbish (and that's saying something) - my DVD of the silly 'She Killed In Ecstasy', filmed years before this looks and sounds far far better. Shame Daria never made films without Argento that are better than this..	0
John Waters is a very brilliant and odd film director. he brings camp, trash, filth, humor and morality to all of his movies, pushes peoples buttons, goes farther than most dare (and then some) isnt afraid of being censored and does what he does and to me thats brillance. true alot of people will think his work is tasteless stupid and gross but thats the whole point! lol! people who dont have a sense of humor or who are not open minded will not like his movies. these are not for right wing conservatives but they should see them (especially a Dirty shame) to broaden their minds a little more. my personal favorites are Pink Flamingos, A dirty Shame, Female Trouble, Polyester and Desperate Living. Serial mom is also a fav but not in this collection. He has come from underground trash to Queen of filth,trash and crudeness and for not being afraid of being bold, outlandish, outspoken and bizzar, I applaud you John Waters. Brillant	1
"Saw ""Hart's War"" the other night and couldn't really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one.  This film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days.   Here are ten reasons why:1.  This film isn't ""The Great Escape"" and even though he would probably like to think otherwise, Bruce Willis isn't Steve McQueen.  Even though Willis received top billing, this is a Colin Farrell vehicle.  2.  The vast majority of the target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the Reagan administration, much less World War II.  ""Hart's War"" may just as well be a film about a POW camp during the War of 1812.  Anything with Vin Diesel or the Rock would be bound to sell more tickets.3.  As far as depicting life in a POW camp, ""Hart's War"" is pretty much on par with ""Hogan's Heroes"".  The Germans are nice guys with guns who don't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything.  Where did the GI's get all those cigarettes, anyway?4.  Any Stalag Luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the Bruce Willis character as look at him.  As depicted in ""Hart's War"", the camp commandant (as portrayed by Marcel Lures) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the German Army.  His collection of American jazz/blues records is a cute writer's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation, or of the type of men who were in charge of German POW camps.  In reality, the Marcel Lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic.5.  The storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in POW camps, one good example being the POW's who were tried and hung in Andersonville;  However, the whole idea that the camp's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a Jerry Springer type advocate is ludicrous.6.  The idea that during the trial, a group of POW's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting.  Not only did nothing like this ever happen during World War II, it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions.  The German army simply wasn't that stupid.7.  I saw this film once and didn't like it.  I thought that maybe the second time would be better.  It wasn't.8.  Beyond being sheer Hollywood political correctness, ""Hart's War"" seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment.  It ignores the real focus of life in such a Stalag which, for most POW's, was just day to day survival.  Also, the soldiers who served in our armed forces during World War II and also happened to be African Americans weren't spineless, hapless dopes.9.  Bruce Willis playing the same role in variations of ""Die Hard"" over and over and over again is tiring.10.  Better films about the same sort of subject matter are ""The Tuskeegee Airmen"" and ""Stalag 17"".  Hopefully in a few years, ""Hart's War"" will be completely forgotten, and these dvd's will be rotting in some landfill. "	0
I really wanted to give Superman Volume 3 a full 5 stars, but unfortunately the quality control of the DVD release is poor, hence the 1 star rating.  The DVD set I purchased skipped at the Green Lantern episode.  The replacement I got also skipped at the same place.  In addition, the two-sided disc format with which all three DVD volumes have been released is a damage prone format.  Luckily I was able to get a full refund, but at this point I'm not sure if or when I'll try my chance at buying this set again.  The lack of quality control is too bad, because Volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series.  If you are fortunate enough to get a DVD set free of defects, then you are really in for a treat.  Bruce Timm and company bring the same high level of storytelling to Superman as they did on Batman: The Animated Series.  Of particular note is an ongoing subplot involving the villain Darkseid throughout the series.  It finally gets put front and center in several episodes of Volume 3, and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series finale.  I felt that the finale could have been written out across three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story, but nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series	0
Aside from the insanely beautiful lead actress, this is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff.  Not scary, only sort of gross, but I think it'd be best in print, Clive Barker deserved better than this	0
I purchased this movie without reading the reviews, based only on my fondness for older movies and the other movies I've seen the two main stars in. This movie was awful, and the sad part is, there were sooooo many opportunities to save the movie all throughout.  The acting was obviously overdone on purpose, I just wish I knew why - it didn't come off as funny or as a satire if that was the intent.  In the end - I threw out the DVD so as not to accidently subject someone else to it	0
This out of all the many versions of Jane Eyre has to be my least favorite...  Granted Samantha Morton has  a very  adorable fairy/ Elfin like face like Mr Rochesters Description of her, but her acting has  no highs and lows. She stands up to Mr Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly no respect to her employer, which is not fault of  hers, the writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran Hinds  is totally over the top. He is so angry with no understanding, his eyes are  very lustful and at times  crazed.  He is not at all like the character  described in Brontes epic book of a very sad and  tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the  innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet strong sweet  Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words.  The over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical.To me there is no love, feeling  or chemistry here between the two actors just lust.... He seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl, and she though supposedy a virgin...  she dosn't act like one. Plus this movie  seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story Especially during Janes childhood. I do also miss the Gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the Dalton /Clarke mini series, which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story. If you want to see great versions. I  highly rate the 1944 movie with Orson Wells though it is another abreviatd version, that movie truly captured the spirit and feel. It is moody dark and mysterious. Another is the fantastic Timothy Dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the  Brontes story.  Dalton's and Clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime! However if you are like me, see them all and make your own decision. They all have something to offer and most are entertaining...	0
How good is Angelina Jolie in this film? It is a testament to this young actor's presence that even as dark and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is, there is not a frame in this film that doesn't feel her infection.Winona Rider is equally excellent as the psychologically confused (or is it enlightened?) hero forced to navigate the depths of her own psyche. The interplay between these two is somehow able to range from the enchanting to the exquisitely painful; but from beginning to end remains capable of leaving you breathless. One look into Angelina Jolie's eyes and you will see the warm, jaundiced decay of a soul no longer battling with sanity. Fear is born of those eyes when you realize how strongly they've tempted your own tired efforts...even as the second look delves closer to a bleakness bearing fruition beyond existential suicide. Presented with the softly rendered and absorbing visualization of a young girl's decent into psychological insecurity; it is a hauntingly supple progression toward the half understood disturbance of what we might have experienced. James Mangold directed this film quite nicely from a very good screenplay; he managed to portray all these young women as young women in turmoil. No melodrama, no over the top sentimentality, just a frank peek into their tumultuous lives. If you've ever questioned your own sanity or escaped periods of exceptional melancholy in your life, this film is certain to trigger old fears. But it is also certain to remind you how exquisite and simple salvation can often be. This film deserves that second look, as well as its painful salvation: a jaundiced beauty whose tragic death is no less healing than the memory of a lost friend. It is a heavy drama, so be forewarned! And a very moving drama at that.	1
You know, I actually enjoyed the first Mummy. It was funny, the idea, not often seen in modern films, was good, and the characters were each, in their own way, entertaining to watch.Why, God, why did they have to go and make a sequel? I don't understand. Was it for the money???I'm not sure when exactly I began to hate this; maybe it was somewhere in between the horrible and almost nonexistent plotline and the stupidity of the main characters making the same mistake AGAIN. Really, you'd think after the first time they accidentally woke a mummy from it's thousand-year rest they'd learn their lesson. But oh, no; the first time wasn't enough.  And, also, the whole having a kid thing, didn't seem to work. The relationship between the characters wasn't the same anymore. I hate it when they do that in movies: make sequels and give the once-cool, main characters children. Nothing against it, just felt wrong for this movie. Throughout most of this movie, I felt stupid, and I don't like for things to make me feel that way. I also felt embarrassed to have actually paid for my tickets at the theater. Maybe it's just me; I just didn't like it.Question of the day for American Cinema: What's the deal with being obsessed with sequels????? Come on, the first was good enough.You know what the worst thing is?-I was actually looking forward to seeing this	0
"My six year old (who has NEVER been very excited about exercise) really loves this DVD. The routine is active, fun and most importantly easy to learn.  Other videos have simply left her frustrated when the routine was complicated or very little instruction was offered. She completed the workout the first day and when she woke up the next morning, she asked to do it again! My 2 1/2 year old has a great time ""dancing"" with us as well"	1
I don't consider myself a hardocre 50 Cent fan, but I went out and bought this after getting a preview of it in an issue of XXL.  It wasn't all that entertaining.  The documentary doesn't really tell the people anything that we don't already know.  We've seen all these videos before, but the video for &quot;Heat&quot; is straight wack.  The street version of that video is much better and somewhat funny.  The Show In Detroit isn't entertaining at all unless you just get a kick out of 10 people on stage chanting the words right along with 50 while making it impossible to understand a word that's being said.  The sessions @ AOL are straight pointless and why did we need an 8 Mile DVD trailer?  The DVD borders on corny, but the CD isn't that bad.  These are all songs that most diehard fans have already heard on his underground bootlegs, but I had not been able to find the &quot;8 Mile Road (G Unit Remix)&quot; ever since I lost my underground CD.  Lloyd Banks kills that track and that song is now contained on this CD / DVD release.  If you're a Young Buck fan, you should know that he's nowhere to be found on this release.  Overall, The New Breed isn't completely terrible, but it loses its novelty after one or two uses.  The three songs on the CD are decent, but you probably have them already.  I would only reccomend this to the die hard 50 Cent / G Unit fans	0
"I was hoping that ""Socermania"" would be on the ""Extreme Sports Fun"" DVD but NO! Instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the ""Disney Treasures"" this also goes for the other two DVD's Extreme Music and adventure fun, allthough 'Pluto's Blue Note', 'Donald's Dilemma' 'No Sail' 'Old Sequoia' and 'Trailer Horn' are on DVD for the first time but with the new Disney Treasures ""Disney Rarities"" and ""The Chronological Donald volume 2""(which might I add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration) who needs these DVDs, so I suggest not to buy these cheap DVD's and buy the Treasures in spite of the bad restoration"	0
maybe because I didn't like Porco. Everything was sub-par for me. Animation is definitely not as good as his later movies. Not enough weirdness, tried too much for the plot. Everything was just too ho-hum. As if he tried to carry the whole movie on Porco's shoulders. But once you got past the fact that everyone else was human and Porco was a pig there wasn't anything else there.	0
Both movies are great, each one of them has it's own charm.Ashley Judd shows she is a great comedian, and Hugh Jackman is one of the best actors of his generation.  The movie is soo funny...it shows what we women are like when a man breaks up with us, and that love is where you least expect it.As for Brown Sugar, it's very sweet, entertaining and funny to watch. I didn't know the actors of this movie and they are amazing. Perhaps love is next door	1
"As part of my ongoing quest to catch up on comic book movies that I have missed over the past few years I came across this clunker. I understand, of course, that I am not the target demographic here. Most comic book fans want nothing more out of their movies than authenticity; unfortunately I was looking for an actual cinematic experience. Four scientists go gallivanting around space with some chump named Dr. Von Doom (who wins the award for the Most Obvious Name for a Villain Ever); they run into trouble and are the recipients of super powers (now we're talking) thanks to some chemical filled cloud. What follows is one of the most shameless attempts to buy a box office victory in history. Special effects pile on top of bad special effects as the film is quickly reduced to nothing more than a dull fireworks show. We get The Thing caving in the front of a semi-truck with his shoulder as the money shot, but it comes in the middle of a scene that left me mystified. An entire bridge and just about every car on it are destroyed by these four farting around with their found powers. But since these are the good guys we have to watch as they scramble to save everybody they endangered, and succeed. Destruction for the fans, no consequences for the characters. But why would director Tim Story try anyways? He knows the people are just showing up to ogle at Jessica Alba as she pretends to act. So instead of focusing on the story he focuses on making sure that those dozens and dozens of product placements make it into the frame. He should have just directed a Pepsi commercial with Jessica Alba and saved us the trouble of watching this mess.The plot is also outwardly defiant in its interest in being even a little entertaining. Instead of watching good fight evil we are stuck watching the superheroes squabble. They aren't even aware that the bad guy is the bad guy until the last fifteen minutes of the movie. They go out, show off their powers (in things like extreme sports, you know, for the kids), and then yell at each other for not being discreet enough. There is also a lackluster love triangle between Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Dr. Von Doom (Julian McMahon). I'm sure it is real nice to believe that someone who looks like Jessica Alba would rather go out with a lowly scientist as opposed to the all powerful, all wealthy Dr. Von Doom. But chances are if you're chasing someone that looks like her she's not interested in your kind demeanor and meaningful career. So why is my rating so high above the zero I've been talking it up to be? Well it is what it is. It didn't put me to sleep as it washes over you fairly harmlessly and quickly. It was fun watching TV actors such as Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon try their luck at a Hollywood blockbuster. And at least it wasn't ""Catwoman."" But what it was was insulting. Beyond the obvious point that nobody would believe Jessica Alba as a scientist lies another that shows just how stupid Story thinks we are. At a newsstand, on the cover of People magazine there is a picture of Sue Storm. Now if Stephen Hawkings can't make it to the cover of People then what chance does this two-bit scientist have? **1/4 "	0
Well, at least she does for my 3 and a half year old daughter.  Each episode is compact with a simple theme covering the whole educational gambet.

Appleseed suffers from the problem most big budget, CGI enhanced anime theatrical releases have: Gorgeous visuals, but a incomprehensible story filled with dull cliche dialog. Trust me, I was sucked in by the amazing trailer like most of you. I wanted this to be a great movie (as I am a fan of the OAV animated series). Appleseed is worth seeing for the visuals alone... but that is about all	0
OK, I rounded up to 4 stars. This really isn't bad, though.It's an idiom that most American viewers won't be familiar with. The major characters are Kuan Yin, Confucius, and a flock of other gods, godlings, immortals, buddhas, figures from myth, and other well-known figures and stereotypes from the Chinese pantheon. There are the flying heroes, improbable weapons, and acting at least on a par with the Dr. Who series. In other words, lots of viewers will see it as alien, disconnected, and amateurish, as well as being filled overly convenient miracles.But it's not in the Western idiom, so parts of it have to be taken in their own terms. And it has the look of a low-budget film, so you won't see effects on the Star Wars scale. And it is a bit cheesy and over-the-top, which is part of the appeal.The fights are bloodless, the romance is chaste, and all but the youngest kids will understand the characters. If you don't take it or yourself too seriously, there's a lot of fun in this one. //wiredweir	1
"I admit that my expectations were totally wrong concerning this film. I was expecting a Spanish reworking of Noel Coward's famous play about the dead returning to humorously haunt the living. The advertising for Volver in the local media certainly led me to have this expectation. Maybe this is why I found this film to be so perplexing and disappointing. But even on it's own terms I found Volver a difficult movie to enjoy. Others see a celebration of strong women. I see a movie about murder, incest, deceit and theft. Every main character here is a criminal. Raimunda, her mother, her daughter, all commit one crime or another, some truly monstrous. Who is there to admire? This is empowerment? I'm trying to avoid spoilers here but suffice to say there is not one truly likable character in this whole film.Aside from the overall unpleasantness of the movie a director as experienced as Almodovar should have produced a tighter work than this. There are numerous loose plot threads here. The whole subplot concerning the Jerry Springer-like tv show didn't really make any sense. The restaurant owner seems to like Raimunda but nothing comes of this. In fact the whole restaurant subplot just peters out, with no resolution. When the movie ended my first thought was ""What, that's it? It's over?"". People might say ""Well, life has loose ends"" but this is a movie, not life. It should have an ending. I know I'm definitely in the minority concerning Volver. My wife thinks I'm nuts for not liking this film but I really think the emperor has no clothes here"	0
This movie, while not a bomb or a turkey, has a couple of serious flaws. One is the casting. Ted Wass has lots of credits to his name, according to IMDb, but what a wimpy, character-less, uninteresting washout he is! Was Blake going for a Harold Lloyd lookalike? He got one, but there's nothing else to recommend him. He looks like a Clark Kent without the Superman suit underneath.The other flaw is the length. Even the opening credits (using a deFreiling/Patie ripoff style) go on forever. But the slapstick, which is masterful as always (Blake having been raised on or at least heavily influenced by silent comedies, especially those of Laurel & Hardy)...my God, does he stretch things out here!The cameos are the saving grace, especially Roger Moore's. His vocal impersonation of Clousseau is perfect. Why didn't he dub the voice for Clousseau in the concurrently filmed TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER? Whoever did that voiceover sounded like Sellers on helium!It's sad to see our icons age, especially Burt Kwouk, who looks and sounds awfully tired. David Niven looks as close to death as he actually was. Rich Little's uncredited overdubbing was beautifully done: subtle and convincing.Herbert Lom's Dreyfuss got bigger and more ridiculous in each successive film. And Harvey Korman's Prof. Balls is delightful. The entire scene in his shop is a stitch.No, there will never be another Sellers (and I have no intention of seeing the new film with Steve Martin). But Blake could have done better with his stopgaps	0
My boyfriend and I went to this movie we both hated it.  It was really pathetic.  Perhaps the fact that we actually know men who are engineers and physicsts who are like this is part of it.  Yeah there are people who cannot interact with women or people.  It is pathetic.  I would feel sorry for anywoman dating this man or any man like this because they lack confidence and are so hard to deal with.  Low self esteem.  Do you want to see a pathetic portion of the population yeah this is them there are actually people like this.  Perhaps it is funny, but just do not be around one of these people in reality.  It is a painful reminder of how screwed up they are.  Not all men are virgins like this man, but some might as well be because they have no clue about women.  they do not know how to open a door or hold a hand.	0

This is a wonderful show and very true to the band's recent live performances, albeit with a condensed songlist. I give it only 4 stars because I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Winwood and band live and the Sound Stage gig seems just a tad below that experience--which is admittedly an unfair comparison. Nothing to knock about this tidy show by a true virtuoso (actually a band of virtuosos). Consider it 4.5.	1
The most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone. The movie is a Nokia product placement, highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and, conversely, what a phone can do for you if you have one. The plot centers on Jessica (Kim Basinger) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need. Mystery #1: What is it? After lots of running/driving in various parts of L.A. the bad guys round up Jessica's family, while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them. Mystery #2: how will the cell phone save the day?Mystery #3. Watch for the credits at the end of the film. They show up on a...? Yep, you got it	0
I watched the first half hour of this and couldn't get through it. I dislike Michael Moore as much as anybody, but the fellow that put this piece together needs to go back to film school. It's an amateurish, whining documentary made more for spite (and those 15 minutes we all want) than anything else. Getting called down by Michael Moore at a public event and then talking to some sympathetic people outside (people who probably just had nothing better to do on campus that night) doesn't prove that Michael Moore followers are all waffling malcontents, dude. Overall, I rate this film FAIL	0
"With the $70-million that was spent on the 2005 video-game-inspired film ""Doom"", you'd think that director Andrzej Bartkowiak would have used better lighting so that the audience could actually see what was going on more clearly.  On second thought, given that this predictable film was little more than 100 minutes of ""shoot the mutants"", it's pretty clear that Mr. Bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment.  As to the film's plot, it can be summarized in a single sentence:  a group of �ber-soldiers lead by their ""Sarge"" (played by The Rock) travel to Mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh-eating mutants after injecting a criminal with DNA recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a Martian archaeological dig.  So, there's tons of shooting, a lot of screams, gallons of fake blood & guts being tossed about, a Martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small-scale version of ""The Sphere"".  Others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include Karl Urban (�ber-soldier John Grimm) and Rosamund Pike (as John Grimm's sister named Sam).  Why these two actors would stoop so low as to participate in ""Doom"" defies logic.To anyone who actually paid good money to watch this 1-star film in a theater, you have my deepest sympathy.  To anyone thinking of purchasing a copy of ""Doom"" on DVD, please notice that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap price.  That alone should tell you how ""good"" this film is"	0
This movie was probably the best one next to Lucario and the Mystery of Mew and Jirachi Wish Maker. Pokemon Ranger centers around the legendary Pokemon Manaphy and of course Ash and his friends. Some new and amazing characters include Buizel, Jackie the Ranger, Mantyke, and Chatot the annoying but funny Pokemon. The villian is great, the ending is amazing, and the effects were the best yet	1

"I used to have respect for Bill Maher. He used to actually inspire me when it came to being brave enough to argue my own opinions without making apologies; but not anymore. My respect dissipated as his fairness was replaced by blinding hatred for GWB and religion. I watched ""I'm Swiss"" once and almost couldn't refrain from vomiting. He talks about the usual suspects: the president, religion, obesity, same-sex marriage, Rap, and few other things that ""comedians"" are good at joking about and liberals are good at preaching about. I know, I know, he's not a liberal, he's a libertarian. Well, I have watched and listened to Bill Maher and I know which side he's on most of the time, and it sure isn't on the right. He hates organized religion and traditional morality too much to be on the right much of the time. I don't know why his panties are in such a bunch. Being organized is better than being disorganized (I can tell jokes too). I'm not religious; and I can't help but see much of it as hard to swallow, but I'm not arrogant enough to call all of it just a bunch of fairytales created and believed by people with neurological disorders. I wasn't there when the Bible was written or when the events took place. I can't say it's all fairtyales. I can only say some of it isn't logical. But, I respect religion and its purposes; which is what separates me from him. He has no qualms about crushing the hope of people who believe in an afterlife or religion, which are both things that make life more bearable for them. The purpose of religion is to provide hope and solace and relief to people who are living in desperation. The same purpose of drugs I might add: something Maher not only defends but abuses. Why the double standard?  This is no longer the eleventh century where Protestants are killing Catholics. The only people k/illing in the name of religion are fanatical Muslims, but most religious people are good, decent, nonviolent individuals. Maher's not an atheist, but he has recently expressed a ""could be, could be not"" attitude toward the existence of a G/od, which would make him agnostic. But one thing is for sure, atheism has more blood on its hands than religion does. Two of our biggest mass murderers--Hitler and Stalin--were atheist. It's a shame when non comedians are actually funnier than Maher, who wears the comedian label but is too bitter to be a good one. Most of the time, he can barely get the joke out without laughing at himself. I laughed twice during the entire show. No one has ever accused Maher of being modest. He's a smug, intellectual elitist. And those are his GOOD qualities. ""I'm Swiss"" displays this all too clearly. In case you didn't know, ""I'm Swiss"" is a running joke of Maher's embarrassment of being an American. He'd rather belong to a country where ethics are a substitution for, not an extension of, morality; where any depraved activity that has no victim is not immoral at all; where adultery is seen as cute, not sinful; where there are no fat people; where the only women who exist are the pretty ones he can sleep with or the ugly ones who agree with his opinions.Thank God I live in America and not Switzerland."	0
I have waited years for this release to be laser scribed onto DVD--it is here! A very good movie. I have to say the Inspector Carson (belonging to an unknown federal agency), character played by Kurtwood Smith is good if not great acting. He epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to hate. His lines in the movie (particularly when he and Border Patrol Agent Bobby Logan, Kris Kristofferson) discuss 'politics' during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the nuttiest best. The conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these lines as their mantra....Great bit part acting by Rip Torn, Roberts Blossom (as the desert rat), Tess Harper and the young and sultry Jean Smart.Kris Kristofferson does a great job with his lines and acting capacity and Treat Williams does ok as well.Anyone who has been in law enforcement--or any other supervisory capacity for that matter--has seen the idiocy and vacuum headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the Border Patrol: Totally inept.The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream is one of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and draws you into the scenes. A must see movie.	1
PRETTY GOOD!MY BROTHER IS A HUGE ELMO FAN,AND HE LOVES THE ELMOS WORLD DVD`S!THIS IS HIS FOURTH FAVORETE ONE!HE WATCHES IT ALMOST EVERY TWO DAYS	1
I saw this movie in theaters probably when it first came out in 2001, but I didn't pay too close attention, because I forgot about it. However, I remembered seeing it in theaters one day when I was browsing the DVD section, and decided to give it another shot at home. I am so glad I did! Leelee Sobieski is absolutely gourgeous and did a flawless job with the film. She has a bright future in acting ahead of her. Basically what happens is, Ruby (Sobieski) and her brother Rhett's (Trevor Morgan) parents die in a car accident. Their parents wished for them to go live with the family's former neighbors, the Glasses, (who had since moved to Malibu) played by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane. Needless to say, Ruby and Rhett's carefree lives are changed dramatically. Rhett falls for all the gifts that the Glasses buy for him, but Ruby isn't fooled so easily. She begins to suspect that her parents' death wasn't an accident, and starts to investigate. She sees certain things and observes certain behaviors exhibited by the Glasses that only make her more suspicious. Eventually, she figures out that the Glasses are behind the car accident and are now after Ruby and Rhett's 4 million dollar fortune that was left to them by their parents. I won't give away the rest, but the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of excitement and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last second! Rent it, or better yet, buy it! It's well worth your while!	1
MAN, I HATE THIS! I cannot take this any more. Watch the original and that is it. The original needs no sequel at all. Every sequel to the original sucks	0
They say all the major characters come back in `Stitch the Movie,' quickly made direct-to-video sequel to the hugely popular `Lilo and Stitch.' For me, the original film's most appealing part is, and will be, Lilo and Stitch, one of the most delightful characters Disney created in the last decade. Do we still need Pleakley when we have Stitch? How about Cobra? Or some alien whose name you have forgotten? Do we need them? No, I don't think so.But `Stitch the Movie' crammed all these characters into this small film of which running time barely exceeds one hour, together with a weak story that repeats exactly what the original was doing. The original's idea of `Ohana' or `family' is changed to `cousin' this time, but for most of the viewers this is literally a twice-told story, no longer attractive enough.What makes us feel short-changed is, however, the lack of music and scenery, the impressive parts of `Lilo and Stitch.' Instead of Elvis songs, they have thrown in parodies or homage to other films and TVs like Monty Python and Ed Wood, completely missing the target audiences who would buy this DVD to experience the joyful sound and rhythm of this great singer. Moreover, the charming, water-color Hawaiian scenery is reduced to the generic, unimaginative backdrop which is barely OK even by the lower standard of the Disney's cheap sequels.The only saving grace is the presence of the actors who provided the voices to the characters. Except that, and the funny but brief scenes about the lovely pair Lilo and Stitch, `Stitch the Movie' looks like a pilot film for the original. Or perhaps it is.	0
"Director:  Denzel WashingtonCast:  Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant, Salli Richardson, Malcolm David Kelley, Cody Hodges, Leonard Earl Howze, Novella Nelson.Running Time:  120 minutesRated PG-13 for violence, language and mature thematic material involving child abuse.Based on a true story, and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from his own book, ""Antwone Fisher"" is at heart a study of psychological disturbance, laced with reasonable amounts of Hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit. It's a peculiarly American medicine, swallowed less willingly in some markets than others, which probably explains why criticism of the film often confused Denzel Washington's directorial talents (which are generally good) with the various workings of his film's plot, which can be argued about.  Antwone Fisher's story starts in the navy, where after a particularly vivid nightmare he slugs a fellow shipmate, and is hauled up before the Captain. Sent to navy psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Washington), he begins to work out issues of anger that, it turns out, stem from an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead friend. At the same time Fisher (played exceptionally well by newcomer Derek Luke), struggles to establish a first adult romantic relationship with the inviting Cheryl (Joy Bryant). In a parallel plot thread, Washington's character, the ever-reasonable Dr. Davenport, is having marital problems. In due course we discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and Fisher is a catalyst for his own change. Fisher's screenplay reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route: after his stint in the navy and with little writing experience, he was hired by a Sony executive to write his own story - a process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it was acceptable. Most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to the uncertainties he brings to his new craft, although Washington's direction papers reasonably well over many cracks. The most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve around the main character. These include the psychiatrist's ironic domestic problems, as well as Fisher's tentative love life. One is tempted to see these narrative distractions as rather manipulative bolt-on elements, leavening the appeal of a central, harrowing, personal history. The Fisher - Cheryl romance for instance, while in context necessarily clumsy, is also ultimately gauche. And once consummated, it is left to languish without further comment, as if further exploration of this side to Fisher's maturing was unnecessary.  Perhaps sensing this central weakness, Fisher's script introduces another element into the young African-American's tortured life as a foster child. During flashbacks he has to deal with 'slave-nation' justifications from Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), suggesting a link between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done to the whole black race - a reasoning which is frankly unconvincing and none too interesting. Significantly, such issues are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself, and soon disappear from view. On the plus side is the central performance by Derek Luke as the hero, a perfectly judged acting job, that neatly balances inner rage and confusion - ""I don't know what to do"" - with lack of self-pity. Washington's role is also well done. Given the difficulty of the actor-director role, he is to be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without fuss, either in front or behind the camera. This is Washington's directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a thorough picture of Antwone and even though the film could have benefited from some tighter editing, it's still a film that delivers all the emotional goods. Arguably the most impressive thing about this film is the casting of Luke who was a total unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his resume and obviously Washington knew he possessed the right goods to pull off the role. Despite its flaws, ""Antwone Fisher"" is an intriguing look into the real life of an estranged, enigmatic individual; it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make you wish that small children didn't have to endure such horrors."	1
"This DVD contains three episodes of ""Bear in the Big Blue House."" The first two have a birthday party theme. The final one doesn't really anything to do with a party, but it is still rocking.The fun starts with ""Mouse Party"" when our friends in the Big Blue House put together a surprise party for Tutter the mouse. The viewer is asked to keep the secret as they prepare the party - putting together the decorations, making the cake and keeping Tutter in the dark. Tutter considers the fact that he's getting older and finally, viewers rock to ""Happy, Happy Birthday"" when the time comes for Tutter's big party.Next comes ""Bear's Birthday Bash."" This is an episode that recalls ""Mouse Party"" in many ways, except this time it's Bear who's having the birthday. He'd like to have a nice, relaxing day, but the kids of the Big Blue House decide to throw him a surprise party.Finally, ""Dancin' the Day Away"" finds everyone in the Big Blue House having some fun with dance. Tutter, however, doesn't think that he can dance, but Pip and Pop show him that he really can.This is a fun show with awesome singing and adorable characters and stories. My favorites are Tutter and Ojo (and the big old Bear himself), but they're all wonderful. This DVD includes bonus sing-alongs of the various songs"	1
when this movie starts it is so dark you can't even see anything. The only way you can know what is going on it to read what Amazon tells you. After that it is just stupid.	0
This was purchased as a gift for my sister. She has said that the DVD set is great. She is a fan of Alias	1
About the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music. The producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who's not screwed-up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick, incestuous, and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in. If you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood, don't watch this	0
Two of the worst stories in the history of TOS, but for different reasons. The 'Way to Eden' makes the mistake of trying to be trendy, and so dates badly.  What the real problem is though is that it makes the Enterprise crew seem to be the disapproving establishment, especially of all people Captain Kirk. 'Requiem for Methuselah' is at heart a reasonable story with the assertion that one man could be responsible for the work of Da Vinci, Brahms and others.  What it completely fails to do is have any appreciation for Kirk's relationships with women.  Threre is no way any woman would have Kirk obsessed to the point he would fight for her, he is far to full of his own importance for that. This effectively trashes any credibility that the story would have had because this is the crux of the whole episode. A real pity	0
This movie is truly wonderfully done.  I appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters, and the deep resonances of director Zhang Yimou's commentary on academics in modern rural China.  The language is particularly good for students learning Mandarin Chinese, as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken Chinese in the countryside and in the cities.  There are English subtitles for beginners as well.  I highly recommend it. 	1
I'm not a big fan of Bruce Campell but I was appalled while viewing this film. I know it's a B Horror film but there was no orginality in this movie. I know it's suppose to be funny but come on people, was it really? The only part that was slightly funny was when Campell's wife was going after the Gypsy for the first time.Needless to say, I think it's interesting that this movie was a book.Going off subject, however, on a late night talk show Bruce acknowledged that there was no such thing as a PG-13 horror film. I'll conform with that.	0
What a HUGE disappointment this release is.  I was suspecting that it wouldn't be all that great when I saw that the studio that originally produced this show, 20th Century Fox, was the same video company releasing it.  Well, the first season looks horrible.  The source material is all 16mm dupe prints, some parts of which are out of focus, scratched and dirty.  In all cases the image is soft and, well, like 16mm.  Compared to what Fox is releasing of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, produced the same year (1964) and at the same studio as BOONE, this release is nothing short of a disgrace.  We should be given pristine 35mm source material, and we're not.  I suspect Fox wouldn't release the original camera negs from it's vaults without a substantial fee.  Anyway, season one of DANIEL BOONE isn't worth buying.  I haven't seen season two, when the show started filming in color, but I'm now afraid to look	0
Seriously, I am an expert, and this movie sucks. But, imagine for a moment--yes, stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices--a movie whose premise is truly profound, strikingly engaging, and culturally challenging--that art is only such relative to those individuals, those `experts', whose tastes, likes and dislikes, decide it so. Given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical--a matter of pure subjective opinion--why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all? Besides this interesting question, which is put forth explicitly, without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry, and in about 60 seconds, the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration. Avoid at all costs.	0
Just repeat the following several times.1) Draggy plot2) Uninspired acting, especially Allen, who almost sinks it3) unimaginative (story, direction, etc)Then get a Hitchcock film	0
Wow, this was awful! The best thing about this DVD is that it doesn't last long. My boyfriend and I sat down to watch this together (in the mood to begin with) and both of us were completely turned off by it. The woman is not even naked, and wears a nightie throughout the DVD. She also is extremely hairy (a matter of personal taste I know, but this was very extreme). The tone of it was decidedly unsexy, more of a strictly how-to than a way to excite the watcher(s). It seemed to me to be very low-budget and unimaginative. Spend your money on something else if you're looking for sexual excitement..	0
The strange and baffling career of Cuba Gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of Denzel's TRAINING DAY.  Unfortunately, Cuba's not Denzel and this movie is way below the quality of DAY.  Filled with enough foul language to fill the Pacific Ocean, the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie, filled with bad cops---where's the good ones?  Clifton Collins Jr., so good in CAPOTE, is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of Cuba who is going to testify in Internal Affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust.  All though this Cuba swaggers like a rap star and Collins has to try and act tough with him.  There's an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film	0
"****THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!***Anyone who saw this growing up has a soft spot in their hearts for it; I've encountered enough people over the course of my 37 yrs who perk up at the mention of it to be aware of its place in a lot of our memories. This has been satirized on the Simpsons, which proves it has embedded itself in the national pop culture consciousness. Anyone who has read the book its based on, the incredible ""I am Legend"" by Richard Matheson, knows that this film has very little in common with it beyond its intial premise--and even that is not followed too closely. All of the criticisms of THE OMEGA MAN are valid: It is very dated and not at all scary or intense and some of the stunts and special effects are laughably, ludicrously cheesy; the villains--who should have been more terrifying than even Romero's zombies--are just crazed albino hippie Luddites and the last half of the film, once Chuck hooks up with Rosalind Cash and the kiddies, is really a let down. But the scenes that open the film of Heston hefting a cool-looking machine gun while decked out in Austin Powers-style finery (!) staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the deserted city still pack a punch. This was the second movie, after 1959's THE WORLD,THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL, to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city. Both films established the visual motif of streets  filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling trash.After years of seeing this on tv -- a guaranteed late September or early October event every year for a few years on the local tv station during my Pacific Northwest childhood in the old dark ages before CABLE TV and the videocassette revolution, its nice to see this movie on DVD with a beautiful widescreen transfer. It looks and sounds great. As a child I always liked the music, particularly the ""surprise party"" theme that plays when the villains make thir first appearance.It rocks here in all its xylophone and funky electric organ and horns glory"	1
What was John Singleton thinking.  I know he produces good films but this is far worse.  The Shaft from the 70s was sexier, cooler, more aggressive, and classer than Jackson.  This was a watered down verison where Parks and Roundtree made cameos.  It's almost to the point they take the blackness out of the character.  No love making and ect.  Don't even waist your time! If you want to see it, check it out on cable tv or something.  Save your money	0
There are some good things about this film -- it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the Nazi propaganda machine was, for one thing. It also shows the main character, Antoine Moreau, a (fictional) famous French mime, having his eyes opened to the reality of the Nazis' 'final solution' to the 'Jewish problem'. Brought to a Czech town that has been 'given to the Jews' by the Nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the Swiss Red Cross delegation, hopefully persuading them that the Germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Moreau changes his original idea for the performance, hoping to get a 'silent' message to the Red Cross that will let them know the true fate of Jews (and other 'undesirables') at the hands of the Nazis.  I'll briefly mention a couple of less-than-positive observations, and then get into my main problem with the film.  The production values reminded me a bit of a made-for-TV movie -- and from time to time it seemed that the sound was a little out of sync with the picture. The image quality on the DVD could have been much better as well.  Also, the Shanachie DVD release is version of the film that has been dubbed with English.  This is, in the case of this film, not very well-done.  The cabaret singer, for instance, comes across as completely unbelievable in that her voice doesn't match her face or ethnicity in the least.  Everyone in the film winds up with an English accent, which detracts from any authenticity that might have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing.Another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it apples to one of one of the children, Stella (portrayed by Linda Jablonska).  Her voice does not sound at all like that of a little girl. She develops a bit of a crush on Antoine, which in itself seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances -- here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a show, with her as one of the leads, who is kind and supportive and friendly to her, who listens to her ideas and feelings with attention and respect.The problem I had was with one scene in particular.  Stella has been caught on the streets after curfew and chased by police.  She bites one of them and manages to elude them by squeezing through a break in a fence.  In the process of getting away, she gets muddy, scrapes herself bloody in a few places, and tears her clothing.  She goes to Moreau's hotel and climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window.  When he opens it, he is shocked at her condition, lets her into the room, and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes, asking what had happened.  He then draws a bath for her, so she can wash herself.  As Moreau sits down, still in a bit of a daze over what has happened to her, she steps into the bath.  Just before she pulls her dress over her head, she says to him, `No looking.'  He shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says `Of course', then repairs to the adjoining bedroom, where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke, allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy.  A moment later, he hears a noise and looks up to see Stella emerge from the bathroom, completely naked, in a full-frontal nude shot.  Moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers, suggesting that she warm herself.  She climbs into the bed; he covers her up, and steps away to the other side of the room.  There is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred.  He has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy. This shot only lasts a few seconds, but I feel that, regardless of the director's reasoning for shooting it in the first place, it could have been left out.  If the point was to show that Moreau has either had morals all along, or that he has acquired them, it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways.Earlier in the film, Stella had witnessed one of her caregivers, semi-nude, in Moreau's hotel room (Stella saw this from outside).  Given her `schoolgirl crush' on Moreau, it seemed natural for her to become upset over this.  As a result, however, the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour.  This, combined with the `adult' voice dubbed over Stella's, makes the scene even more disquieting.There are some viewers who might argue that, in Europe, `standards' involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the US.  In many instances, I would wholeheartedly agree with them.  There is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of American culture and moral values, and not a little bit of neurosis.  However, the sexual objectification of children is something about which I feel very strongly...and I think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that.  Don't get me wrong -- I'm not so prudish that I turn away from even full-frontal nudity in a film, if it's not gratuitous and it's an integral part of the storyline...but here, it involves a prepubescent girl, and could have easily been left out.  It worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers.  Have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many can't recognize an instance where it's not only unnecessary, but potentially harmful? I'm glad I've seen the film -- and I'd recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations, as noted above. With all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the Holocaust never happened, I think it's vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen. The Czech film ALL MY LOVED ONES is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves -- seek it out.n.b. -- This is the second time I have posted this exact review.  I noticed today (6 April 2006) that it has, for some reason, been removed from the site.  I've re-read what I've written, and I don't see anything objectionable or offensive.  The issues I have with the film are discussed straightforwardly.  If anyone objects to anything I've written here, I'd like to know what it is. 	0
Spurlock has brought new meaning to reality shows.  Constructive, insightful, inspirational, educational, and entertaining, these very interesting journeys had me hooked for 6 hours straight.  Just think what you could do with your own life in 30 days! Should be emmy nominated; it's that good.  Brilliant	1
I had never watched this film before ordering it, so I took the chance.  It turned out to be a smart buy!  As usual, Peck is just awesome.  He seems to fit this role well, as if it captures a true part of his persona as a family man.  As the movie continues you  realize that you can relate to the character on a personal level.  I enojoyed the flashback sequences and thought they were placed well throughout the film.  Overall, this movie supplies drama and action for the viewer.  So, if you are considering purchasing this dvd, I'd suggest you buy it.  You'll enjoy it	1
"Small town America... only this isn't the pleasant and white-picketed small town America of film noir fame, it's the gray and colorless small town America of neo-noir, and there's the man on the sidewalk looking like a lost bum to prove it.  A bum who's being approached by that famous ""Man in a Black Trenchcoat""...Hard Eight (AKA Sydney, but I've yet to see a version of it anywhere that actually claims that title) is a debut pretty much as promising as Blood Simple to the brothers Coen.  Paul Thomas Anderson immediately sets out to give us only the best, with actors he wants to make famous and a script that has characters doing almost nothing we want (or expect) them to do, but who yet remain completely sympathetic throughout.Anderson also uses neo-noir color to great effect, allowing red and blue to do what harsh black and white contrast is supposed to do in classical noir.  That said, Anderson still knows where the majority of the talent lies, and despite the long takes and steady-cam shots that would develop into those dizzying long takes from later movies, he focuses most of his time on the characters' faces, and just lets them be.If he hadn't already done the amazing and always stunning later work of Magnolia, Boogie Nights, and Punch Drunk Love, I'd say that this is a ""promising debut that makes me impatient for the next Anderson picture to come out,"" but since he does now have four classics notched into his belt, I must say, ""See this to see Anderson at his roots,"" and ""Man I can't wait for his next feature!""--PolarisDi"	1
This is fantastic!  Great music, Great story,  Awesome photography!   I promise you will love  this film	1
"Disney made its mark as a major studio in 1937 with its first full-length feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Ironically, given this early success, Snow White was their only hit movie for the next 13 years. World War II kicked the hell out of Disney's overseas markets. Even movies today regarded as classic Disney - Pinnochio, Bambi, Fantasia - lost money on initial release. Disney eked through by diversifying into training films for the US government, and the South American films that were part of FDR's Good Neighbor policy, etc. - stuff that made back its costs but not much more. By 1948, Disney was in dire financial straits. They had just enough money for one more movie. Walt Disney realized he needed a hit or his studio probably wouldn't survive, and it would have to be what they did best: a full-length animated feature film. Walt said to himself, ""What we need is a movie about a girl in trouble. Audiences love that. They loved Snow White."" That's what he wanted: a movie like Snow White, but even more so - more comedy, more drama, more magic, more music, more lovable characters. He chose as the basis of his company's Hail Mary pass arguably the most famous fairy tale in the world: Cinderella.Disney didn't have the money, as they had on earlier films, to lavishly storyboard every scene. Thus they hit upon the wonderfully clever idea of shooting the entire movie in live action, then the animators used stills from that as storyboards. The photos used survive to this day, and many are provided as a Special Edition ""extra."" In some cases these photos have the animator's drawings over them, turning for instance an almost bare stage into a hall in Cinderella's family chateau.In 1950, Cinderella was released and was everything Disney so desperately needed. Even today, Cinderella is arguably the best movie Disney's ever made. It's just awfully hard to argue with any aspect of this film. The animation artwork was a product of Disney's famous ""Nine Old Men"" - at that time not yet old. Cinderella pulls off, superbly, something not particularly easy to do: it integrates believable human characters with funny cartoon animals and makes it work. From Eric Larson and Marc Davis' beautiful and graceful Cinderella to Ward Kimball's wonderful Jaq and Gus-Gus the mice and over-the-top Lucifer the cat, everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural.Part of Walt Disney's plan to out-Snow White Snow White with Cinderella involved its music. He very consciously wanted Cinderella to be a source of hit songs. There had been hit songs from Disney films before (""Heigh Ho"" and ""Whistle While You Work"" from Snow White, ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" from Pinnochio, etc.) but they'd been almost accidental. ""Oh, we have a hit song, well that's nice."" For Cinderella, Disney for the first time went to Tin Pan Alley (28th Street in New York City where the professional songwriters could be found). Disney wanted his girl's music done by the very best craftsmen, the guys who wrote hit songs for a living. The Cinderella soundtrack hit big (a #1 album with 3/4 million units sold) with songs even today considered quintessential Disney, most notably ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" from the movie's opening scene, ""The Work Song"" while the animals help Cinderella clean the house and simultaneously build her ball gown, and ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" (nominated for an Academy Award as best movie song of the year) from the Fairy Godmother transformation scene.For their best movie, Disney apparently spared no expense producing the DVD. Not only has the picture quality been digitally restored, but the audio has also been cleaned up with a new 5.1 surround sound mix. Totally gone is the background hiss associated with so many old movies. (Cinderella has the distinction of being ""the noisiest movie ever restored"" according to its audio crew.) The original mono soundtrack has also been spruced and is provided as an option for purists.A word about the movie's aspect ratio (i.e. how wide the picture is compared to its height). The DVD cover says Cinderella is presented in its ""Original Full-Screen Aspect Ratio (1.33:1)"". This is untrue. Virtually all sound films until 1953, including Cinderella, were 1.37:1. Since a TV screen is 1.33:1, you don't lose a lot when the original is ""formatted to fit your television."" I just wish they hadn't lied about it.Cinderella ends at breakneck pace: we go straight from her foot sliding into the glass slipper to the wedding to Happily Ever After, bing, bang, boom. Walt Disney believed ""Audiences like a happy ending, but they don't like a happy ending that goes on too long."" Hey, who am I to argue? Well, maybe I'll argue. A DVD extra addresses scenes originally planned for the movie but not actually used. One of these would have occurred after the fitting of the glass slipper and before the wedding: Cinderella is taken by the Grand Duke to the castle in her normal everyday clothes; the first time Prince Charming sees her since the ball she's not wearing a lovely gown, she's wearing her scullery maid outfit. Cinderella is frightened, how will he react when he realizes she's not a fine lady but a poor servant girl? And of course he doesn't care how she's dressed, he loves her anyway. I can **see** that scene in my mind, it would have worked beautifully. This is the one way in which an almost perfect movie could have been even a tiny bit better"	1
"I just watched ""Mommie Dearest"" for the first time tonight. As most critics and fans of ""Mommie Dearest"" acknowledge, the film portrays such a pitiful story of abuse, with such an over-dramatic (but entirely true-to-life) performance by Faye Dunaway, it was both hilarious and depressing.  I'm 30 and didn't know much about Joan Crawford outside of the endless chatter about the film being ""classic camp.""  Seems to me Crawford was probably bi-polar or had some other unexplained mental disorder.  I think she was quite aware that some of the insanity she lived with was caused by movie industry she was dedicated to. She knew the industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored to do, whether it was having a successful marriage, a happy family, or even giving to charity. Her life was a running commercial directed by Hollywood, not unlike the tabloid-driven, image-obsessed Hollywood we have today. Despite the often-times hilarious image of her and her sibling's victimization on film, Christina's abuse and disappointment with her mother was real and painful at some point in her life. Christina Crawford was completely justified turning her mother's image on its head with her book and movie. Yes, the movie is outrageous but it is also empowering. After all, what can the powerless do about their pitiful past except laugh. Mocking the unexplained, unjustified pain you experienced in the past, renders it powerless to harm your future. This is the legacy of ""Mommie Dearest"" whatever Joan Crawford really was"	1
"Based on Bizet's tragic Spanish opera, this was Rita Hayworth's first film made by her production company, Beckworth (derived from her screen surname and from the name of her daughter, Rebecca). She decided on her close friend and favorite leading man, Glenn Ford, as Don Jose to her Carmen. The results are far better than some reviews would have you believe.The glorious, lush Techincolor is fabulous (studio-bound as most of the sets may be), while Hayworth's unforgettable screen presence, dancing and bewitching beauty, and the heat generated between her and Ford makes this movie memorable. The sequence in which she describes what virtues a lover should have (complete with putting her finger to his lips) sparkles with sensual static. Granted, Ford looks stiff and ill at ease in his uniform (after he sheds his soldier garb and dons his ""bandit clothing"", he appears much more relaxed).If it is deemed worthy enough to be released as part of the Columbia Classics collection, so should ""Affair In Trinidad"", another Hayworth/Ford collaboration.It's just great to look at, flaws aside. If you adore Rita and Glenn, even in a tempestuous, volatile romance, this movie will provide that for you.Was there ever a more enticing, tempestous gypsy with so many men in her life but only one true and ultimately tragic love?  "	1
"...I turned the movie off. Was that supposed to be funny? Yes, some kids' toy (that happens to be a small motorized/electric model of a truck) attacks one unfortunate postman on his route through some deserted village -I mean; was this taken from the original Stephen King-book then shame on you Mr.King -that's overdoing the terror already so overdone. Not that the consept of ""Trucks"" didn't appeal to me, but this must be perhaps the weakest adaption of the so-called horrormaster so far -believe it or not"	0
I thought this was an amazing movie.  It hit close to home with me.  I love Jennie Garth as she is an amazing actress.  This movie was certainly one you could sit down with your family and watch without worrying about language or violence.  This movie inspired me to buy more like it	1
This film starts out so promising.  It could have been a punchy dramatic piece about the nature of belief, and the legitimacy of the concept of free will.  Instead, the characters dribble into infantile sexuality, and the film becomes a travelog.  I can't believe this film found financing...a real waste of obvious talent.  The effect of the ending is to trivialise the opening premise, hence the film winds up being an exercise in meaninglessness with an unpleasant aftertaste	0
Michael Moore can be really funny at times, but most people should not take this goofball too seriously.  About half way through 'The Big One', I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn't know where Moore was going.  What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick?  This is not one of his better films	0
"From 1997 to 2003, Joss Whedon gave his audience some of the best episodes aired on television. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER showcased an empowered young girl saddled with the unintimidating name of Buffy Summers, who, with the help of her high school friends and her stuffy mentor Giles, faced sundry monsters and saved the world - a lot. Along the way, she managed to leave an indelible impact on our pop cultural consciousness. Before its series debut, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, based on its promotional push on TV, seemed slated to be a straight-out horror series starring an erstwhile typical high schooler who battles vampires and demons. But, fairly quickly on, this unassuming little show, thanks to Whedon's intense and witty, pop-culture savvy yet very literate writing, met and surpassed the viewer's expectations. Whedon created compelling stories and characters who grew on the viewers; for seven years, we watched them strive to maintain a normal life as they navigated thru high school, college life, and then to adulthood, all the while frequently facing down supernatural threats. Which brings us to Season 7. Possible SPOILERS follow: Here in the bittersweet and melancholy finale season, Joss Whedon attempts to provide closure to the show and also to bring it full circle to its origins. The opening episode ""Lessons"" has Buffy escorting Dawn, for her inaugural school day, back to good, ol' Sunnydale High, which has just been rebuilt on top of the old one. This, by the way, means that the Hellmouth is very much alive and again active. Somehow, Buffy is offered a job as a school counselor at Sunnydale High by the enigmatic principal, Robin Wood (24's D.B. Woodside). Back in England, Willow, under the tutelage of Giles and a benevolent coven of witches, has been recovering from her turn to the dark side (Season Six) and receives a horrifying glimpse of the future for Sunnydale. Meanwhile, Spike is found dwelling in the Sunnydale High School basement in a bonkers state of mind, influenced by his new soul and possibly also by...something else. Lessee, who's left? Anya is again a Vengeance Demon, though her heart isn't really in it. And Xander is still fixing windows...The season's major story arc involves the return of the First Evil, the original and the source of all evil. The First's return is made possible by the instability caused by Buffy's having died and consequently being resurrected (again, Season 6). Very early on, we get a hint of the season's Big Bad as various Sunnydale denizens spout the ominous warning: ""From beneath you, it devours."" This season also increases the scope of Buffy's world even more as most of the Watcher Council are annihilated and Giles is forced to seek out Potential Slayers (who are also being killed off one by one by Bringers, no-eyed, murdering servants of Caleb and the First) and bring them to Sunnydale for protection. Now, more than ever, Buffy's leadership skills and methods are tested and even questioned as several of the Potentials prove to be uncowed and contentious free thinkers. Buffy has never been forced to deliver as many bracing, rallying speeches as she has been this season, which attests to her foe's overwhelming level of menace. Because the First cannot enter our world in a corporeal form and can only assume the identities of dead people, this is an opportunity for a callback of Buffy's past uber-foes. For one last time, we get to enjoy cameos of the Master, Drusilla, the Mayor, Adam, Glory, and two of the Nerd Trio. Pretty neat. Besides the First, Buffy faces two despicable and truly hard-to-kill villains, who are themselves minions of the First: the Turok-Han, an early caveman type of vampire (thus, even more sturdy than contemporary vampires) and Caleb, the frightening, mysoginistic preacher who convincingly beats Buffy senseless in several encounters. As ever, the writers do an amazing job. The episodes are obviously action-packed. But, underneath the surface, the show is laden with metaphors and symbolisms. Themes of isolation, the isolation of a leader, female empowerment, sacrifice, friendship, and humanity are touched on in great depth. This season is also about the quest for redemption. Most of the members of Buffy's Scooby gang, ironically, at one point or another, were evil or have turned evil in the past: Willow, Spike, Anya, Faith, Andrew...All these characters are trying to find their way back to atonement; it won't be easy. This season has to be the one with the most recurring characters in it. Principal Wood and the Potentials are introduced. Season 7 also marks the return of Andrew, Faith, and, in one episode, Angel. With the glut of additional characters, the core Scoobies are given short thrift here, although Dawn does shine in ""Potential"" and Xander proves his worth in ""Potential"" and ""Dirty Girls."" One episode, ""Selfless,"" really focuses on Anya and paves the way for her eventual return to the fold. Only Spike seems to maintain copious screen time throughout the series. The camera, of course, is ever on Buffy Summers.The arrival of the Potentials does usher in a freshness to the series as it simultaneously takes the spotlight away from the Scoobies. The take-charge Kennedy (Iyari Limon), the feisty Rona (Indigo), and Amanda (Sarah Hagan) prove to be welcome additions to the cast, while the non-English speaking Asian Potential drops some instant funnies. ""Conversations with Dead People"" reintroduces Andrew (the very good, very funny Tom Lenk) as a possible good guy, while ""Dirty Girls"" marks the welcome return of sexy Faith (Eliza Dushku) as her encounters with Spike provide some of the high points of the season. The awesome Nathan Fillion, by the way, is scary good as Caleb.The Special Features provide episode commentaries by various cast and crew members on ""Lessons,"" ""Selfless,"" ""Conversations with Dead People,"" ""The Killer In Me,"" ""Lies My Parents Told Me,"" ""Dirty Girls,"" and ""Chosen."" Disc 3 has the featurette ""It's Always Been About the Fans."" Disc 6 offers up four more featurettes (the 36-minute long ""Season 7 Overview - Buffy: Full Circle""; ""Buffy 101- Studying the Slayer"" - various television critics talk about the show's influence; ""Generation S"" - interviews with the Potentials actresses; ""The Last Sundown"" - a look at Joss Whedon's top 10 favorite Buffy episodes and some of his thoughts about the series); an outtakes reel (not that funny); ""Buffy Wraps"" (the wrap party with cast and crew, but where was Sarah Michelle Gellar?); and for those who care, a DVD-ROM Willow Demon Guide.Years ago, Joss Whedon wanted to shake things up by turning topsy-turvy the cliche of the hapless, little blonde damsel needing a hero to come to her rescue. Seven years of quality television has proven that audiences will accept a tiny girl being capable of slaying monsters while remaining quintessentially feminine. So, above all else, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is meant to be a feminist allegory. But, for those who aren't into that, there's still so much that this season has to offer: an us against the world mentality, superlative action sequences, shivery horror/fantasy elements, witty repartees, heartfelt dialogue, gripping, dramatic stories, and great acting. And, of course, great, iconic heroes in Buffy Summers, Spike, Faith, and crew. Five stars for one of my all-time favorite shows EVER.Oh, yeah, and I like the slim set collection."	1
"uhmm....yah... this is a low budget ""film"", but low budget doesnt mean it has to suck.  i've seen tons of low budget films that were absolutely beautiful pieces of art.  it's impossible to even figure out where to start in reviewing Sideline Secrets; for even untrained actors this is bad, it seemed that the voices were completely dubbed like in an old japanese movie, and i think i even saw someone moving in the background in the supposedly tense office scene when there wasn't supposed to be someone in the backgroung.  i will give whomever a tiny bit of credit though for turning a livingroom & a garage into what was supposed to be a club - and at the end of the home movie, i was pleasantly surprised to see the gogo dancer was actually attractive (quite so too!) as opposed to the rest of the young cast in this trying ever-so-hard to be a soft-core porn\thriller.  in all seriousness, this thing gave me a horrible migraine.  if you are stupid enough to actually buy this (thankfully my roommate rented it) invest in either a bottle of Advil or a sledge hammer - you'll want to use both on your head after the first 20 mins..."	0
Hi Folks,the movies all look very good..and there are a nice group  of bonus features from vintage featurettes to  commentaries!  On  Macao...I particularly enjoyed the 30 minute interview with Jane Russell and  Robert Mitchum  that Robert Osborne conducted...very late in the life of Mr Mitchum.  The packaging it great and frankly 6 films from the great Robert Mitchum at under $10 each on DVD w/bonus features is a terrrrrifffic deal!The movies aren't generally considered Mitchum's best or best known but when you consider you've got Jean Simmons as a costar and Otto Preminger directing Angel Face,  Josef Von  Sternberg helming  Macao, Vincent Minnelli directing HOme From The Hill, The great Fred Zinneman directing and the legend Deborah Kerr co-starring in the Sundowners ...you can figure this isn't the bottom of  the barrel either!  Oh and Sydney Pollack directed The Yakuza and contributes a great commentary....To  sum up...warner Bros...continues to deliver THE VERY BEST classic titles on  DVD with the best combination of quality transfers/bonus features and value packages!!!!	1
I liked this workout the first time I bought it as her fatburning workout.  The second time I bought it re-packaged I thought it was a fluke. This time I bought this since it sounded more like weight training and less like circuit training, so it must be different.  Nope.  I have 5 Kathy Smith videos, all three with different titles and covers only three different contents. I feel this is highly unethical and contacted her company.  One month later and I have yet to receive a response. 	0
"Although many reviewers didn't like the second part of the ""Hills"", I still wouldn't call it ""one of the worst sequels ever"" or ""the worst Wes Craven film"". Certainly this is not a masterpiece, even in the framework of horror genre, but I don't see why it should be worse than any other slasher flick. When I was watching it, I came to a conclusion early Wes Craven had been imitating other directors rather often. I'm not saying he was not original at all - eventually he shot ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" in 1984. But ""The Hills Have Eyes"" were reminiscent of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and in the beginning of 80s, when slasher era started, I guess Craven decided to make something in the same manner. Maybe the reason was Craven's long-time buddy Sean Cunningham created ""Friday the 13th"" in 1980, and Wes was envious? :) Anyway the second part of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" turned out to be a pure slasher like many others at that time. And it obviously wasn't the worst and in many ways was like above mentioned ""Friday the 13th"": the score was written by Harry Manfredini, known to every ""Friday"" fan, and the music in ""Hills 2"" is just like in early ""Fridays"". The body count increased comparing to the first part and approached a regular slasher movie. Kevin Blair who had a leading male part here, would star in ""Friday the 13th part VII"" a couple of years later along with Kane Hodder, who did stunts for ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" and in ""Friday"" would play you know whom. Of course here we can see some stupidities as in other slasher movies (like characters wandering in night all alone instead of sticking together, all the big strong guys get killed, and a handicapped girl survives - I'm not even considering it as a spoiler for it is obvious from the very beginning, especially if you've seen a couple of horror films in your life), but is that a problem for a true horror fan? We've learned not to take this trivia into account. So I think ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" managed on many levels, and it would be interesting to have it in your collection, if you have the first one. For they are two totally different films talking about the subgenres of horror. "	1
"This DVD is way cool with a buch of sport themed episodes. First Scooby and the gang help a baseball hero break a home run record, but the ghost of Cab Crag isn't too happy about having his record broken.  Then they compete in a off road race with a giant worm as a competitor - and what's with the worm worshipers -I mean they go like whoo ""a giant worm is our god, whoo we hate cars"".   Then they go to the Bocephus wrestling facility.  Could they come up with a better name than Bocephus?  There's a really freaky creature which may scare your little sister.  The last episode is, by far, the best.  A hockey ghost is terrorizing the World Cup Hockey event. He's one of the toughest ghosts ever, either that, or the Russian Police are the biggest whimps ever!  I think this DVD is a good buy if you are a Scooby fan, just be prepared, it can get a little goofy. Joey "	1
THE AIDS SITUATION IS FAR GREATER THAN WE ARE TOLD /THE CORRUPTION IN AFRICA IS HORRIFIC / THE SITUATION IS BEYOND ANY HORROR FILM'S SCARE ANYTIME / THIS FILM OF LECARRE'S NOVEL BEARS GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR FUTURE ,OUR DESTINY .

Cheesy instructorthe instructor's voice covers the music in the background which turns you off going on with the exercize, the music itself is monotonous and the beat is not inline with the moves. the instructor is too fast to follow..to cut it short i do not recommend this for anyone ..totally not professional	0
"I'm probably going to invest in a re-order of this DVD collection, because I simply have worn this one out. From the ""They Call It Pro Football"" opening to final gun of Super Bowl X, this collection grips your attention and never lets go. The writing is superb - I especially like NFL 68' - and The highlights... Well, it was when pro football was pro football. It was interesting watching teams endure psychological hardships, as was the Case with the Dallas Cowboys of the late 60's- Early 70's. ""Next Year's Champions"" were the epitome of resiliency.  ""The Championship Chase"" was a pure joy to view. If ever there was a peak in John Facenda's narrative career with NFL Films, this was it; though in the alternative, I loved his voice-overs in Super Bowls III, IV, VII, and IX.  Ed and Steve Sabol Really hit the bulleye with Blair Motion Pictures. I would have loved to see more AFL highlights, but that's just nit-picking. GREAT JOB!!!"	1
I normally do not enjoy movies about the making of movies, so I was very pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained by 'Living in Oblivion'.  The reason I took the chance at all was due to the presence of Catherine Keener, one of our most overlooked and under-appreciated Hollywood actresses.  She once again did not disappoint, but the entire cast was extremely good.  You get a real education on the frustrations and challenges involved with making a low budget film.  Buscemi is also right on target as the stessed out director.  The Amazon reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for good reason.  I'm glad to join my fellow Amazonians in heaping praise on this low budget gem	1
  This was so messy and Mr. Dorrington so over the top inhi self promotion. YUK.!..my partner and I were disgusted.He and his deceased friend/photographer are the rotten people who enter jungle animal habitats and cause the animals so much stress as to charge at them and these creeps can take photographs and brag-Degenerates for sure.Too damn bad for your buddy. It was obvious this was not quite of the caliber daring/bold/ and challenging as some of Herzogs past films. We have been fans for 20+ years. Looks like he did it for the money and Dorrington rodeHerzogs coatails in  a way. Geez..I had just watched March of the Penguins and Wings of Migration and those! are truly documentaries made by film experts. The babbling and rambling on in The White Diamond made me pity Herzog. He did it for the $ maybe.Dorrington yammers on and on in such a disgusting way I suggest you turn the sound off and fast forward to the end shotsof the waterfall and the swifts. Hey Dorrington-Who cares about you? Herzog..Get out of California before you rot	0

"I won't go into the movie itself, as other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that.  Suffice to say that I have always enjoyed ""Cloak & Dagger,"" despite the hokiness of some of the scenes (not to mention the laughable visuals at the end).  This movie still rates at least 4 stars from me.  However, Amazon reviews are supposed to cover the ENTIRE product, and not just the movie itself.In two words:  It stinks.No trailer.  No subtitles.  No scene selections.  No extras of any kind.  Not even a menu.  When you slide the disc in, the movie starts right up.  When the movie finishes, it starts over again.  If you press the ""menu"" button on your remote, nothing happens.  Personally, I'd prefer it if after the movie finished, playback would stop and you'd go to a scene selection menu.  Even a still image telling you the movie was over would be better than playback looping back forever.I suppose I should be glad Universal even bothered to release this movie on DVD.  It's just disappointing that they obviously didn't put any thought or effort into it"	0
That is what this film meant to me, looking at the kaleidiscope of life as it passes by, so sweet, so unsatisfying at times yet so perfect when the right person is there.This film is a poem to Paris and the passing of youth, with the hope of recapturing that one love, which when found engraves itself so deeply that it is like a hinge in the mind, always present, always remembered, always desired.  The two lovers meet, seemingly a lifetime away from when they met by chance on a train, and with instant rapport they tell eachother in the space of a few hours everything that happened since they met 10 years earlier.    They see how much they meant to eachother, how much they still could, like two pieces of a puzzle that fit.  This is a genuinely beautiful film, more mature than the last one, much sadder and in many ways better and more realistic.  It opened that sense of mystery that I have known, in life and its surprises and potential in the luck of finding true intimacy.  Julie Delphy is one of those rare women who gets more beautiful as she ages.  She has become a sad person, stalled in relationships, though she is living up to her ideals.  Ethan Hawke is struggling to grow with his success, in a down phase of his marriage and needing their friendship very badly.  Their relationship, so brief, rings totally true, in its humor, commitment, and occasional awkwardness.  Perhaps this is sentimental, but I think I have known love like this.  It is an image more in my mind than the person perhaps, but our friendship is as deep as it was when we met nearly 35 years ago.  Some people simply pierce thru to the heart, earning a permanent place no matter who they later marry or what they become.  It is an extraordinary sympathy for one another that is beyond sex (well, maybe not too far beyond...).Highest recommendation.  This succeeds brilliantly at a snapshot in time, with an entire history implied behind it, like the greatest art.  And I do think that the ending is ambiguous and must be interpreted, which is also so very much like real life	1
Over half of this movie consists of scenes taken  from the original 1939 classic film directed by Zoltan Korda. Even those scenes can't disguise the remake's network TV-movie quality. Beau Bridges is generally a good actor,  but he is terribly miscast on this film. Go rent both versions of The Four  Feathers and see it for yourself	0
Holly played by Kristen Miller (She Spies, Man of the Year) has a nice career as a journalist with her friend played by Brooke Burns (Baywatch, Death of the Supermodels). The 2 of them fight over the owner of a restaurant named Zucas (I think thats close enough) runned by actor Tod Babcock (Guard Dogs, Poor White Trash). When Holly gets pissed off at her friend because she slept with Mr. Babcock she tries to find a new place to live and low and behold she finds a new shy roommate Tess, played by Allison Lange (The Hillside Strangler, Roswell). Holly becomes close to Tess and they seem to hit it off real well, until Holly finds out some things about Tess that makes her think that maybe this wasnt such a good idea. Well, in 1992, Jennifer Jason Leigh did this to Bridget Fonda and now they make a sequel about it, wow, they must of went threw tons of scripts just to get to this one. Pretty much the young girls on screen are eye candy and the acting is pretty bad plus the twists and thrills arent that great. This can go down with Basic Instinct 2....in the trash can or the skeet shoot, one of the two. Also starring Francois Giroday (Carpool Guy, Framed), Tracey McCall (Not Another Teen Movie, Second Degree), Rif Hutton (Osmosis Jones, Halfway Decent) and Kyme (School Daze, Geppetto).	0
This is an imaginative take on the Jack and the Beanstalk story. While it was apparently made for kids, the story maintains enough complexity to keep adults interested (I'm 19). Plus as a female, I appreciate the fact that it's one of the few stories where (possible spoiler) the damsel (who's in a different kind of distress than other fairy tale women) rescues Prince Charming.  Well-acted, it features some great chemistry between Sara and Modine.  But I still can't give it 5 stars.  Here's why (spoilers ahead):1. I'm no math person but why couldn't the writers be consistent with when Jack's dad died? One minute, they say he died 20 years ago but then they say he died when Jack was 14. Since Jack is 37, it shows that the writers can't do simple addition. Couldn't they just take two seconds to do the math? 2. How the hell does Siggy know about goose and harp? I got the impression from Wilhemina that Jack's dad didn't believe the story of the original Jack. But apparently, Jack's dad told Siggy not to tell him about the family's dark secret until he was ready. I wish there was a more believable explanation for Siggy knowing a lot more than he should. 3. If Siggy is smart enough to know the all the Robinson secrets, I think he should be able to catch on to the fact that Jack is in love with Ondine fairly quickly. I always wondered why he didn't try to kill Ondine when he was so against Jack having an heir.  I understand that they had a time limit to the movie and maybe it would have been a bit scary for the little ones. Don't get me wrong, I don't want Ondine to die.  I wanted nothing less than a happy ending for her and Jack.  But shooting her (or at least threatening her) would have been a great way to kick up the tension/suspense. 4. Siggy's accent and mannerisms were an attempt at comedy thatcompletely fell flat. It was not funny and was a bit gratuitous.But if you're a fan of romance, adventure, or just feel-good movies in general, those things shouldn't keep you from enjoying this film.  Don't think too much about the plot holes- you'll go insane if you do	1
I saw this flick when it first came out, and was chilled to the bone.  It was one of the movies that helped form my opinion about New York City, as well - as a cold, impersonal city where anonimity could swallow you up!Over 35 years later, on review, it is still one of the scariest movies ever made. The twists are nuanced and plentiful, as well as psychologically and emotionally devastating.  Looking for monsters?  One need only look in the mirror.Roman Polanski was - and still is, as far as I can tell - a master manipulator of perception.  Rosemary's Baby is one of his finest films, and its timeless theme - the struggle between good and evil - unfolds in a way that is as real today as it was when first released.Oh, and I braved coming to New York 10 years after the film premiered.  Still here and loving the city!  I realized eventually, of course, that New York, as in so many films, was merely a great setting that provided a wonderful backdrop for this chilling tale to unfold.  A player in the molding of the film's atmosphere - but not the cause! It could have been set anywhere, and been just as effective. 	1

"Denzel Washington is probably my favorite actor. Even in that dog of a movie called THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, he shone. Tom Hanks? Well, lemme quit hating the guy. This is a well-intentioned movie, Tom did a creditable job, and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Antonio Banderas fly in the face of his Latino studliness by playing a gay guy. A passionate one, though, since he's still a Latino, after all. Actually, this is a Hollywood ""message movie,"" and you know what that means. It's about as subtle as Michael Moore. Those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours. Those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie, those who don't agree with the message, stay as far away from it as possible. There's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with AIDS boy. The way they stared at him reminded me of ""lao wei in China"" experiences. Denzel's character was reminded of segregation, even though he's too young to remember it, and started to care about Tom Hanks' character. AIDS discrimination is bad. Actually, any discrimination at all is bad. And that's the movie's message. I agree with the message, but still. That's all we've got. As a totally irrelevant non-sequiter, if the name ""Sam Francisco"" means anything to you, you've seen subtle commentary on discrimination. I love a great courtroom drama. This one was merely good. With so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour film, they had to take a few shortcuts here. Sad, ain't it? But even so, a well-intentioned film that I'm glad I saw. Once. Not twice. Once is enough, thank you.  "	0
Excellent presentation and goes into detail, much of which may be unknown to the viewer.  One minor criticism:  the participants let Stanley Lord of the Californian off much too easily	1
"This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country?  I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc.  I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the ""drug house"" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please.  Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died.  I kept expecting someone to call Social Services.   And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes  because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children.  And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all.   Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have ""gotten"" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed."	0
I agree with everyone that wants old nick. I remember putting on the TV and watching Legends Of The Hidden Temple,Guts,Are You Afraid Of The Dark? and so on. Put them on dvd. People would SURELY buy it	0
I just finished watching Das Boot.  To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous.  Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot	0
"I found this movie to be almost unwatchable.  If your idea of a good time is watching Henry Gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes, then this movie is for you.  The three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it.  Altman can pull off such greats as ""Mash"" and  ""Godsford Park"" and then stink up the joint with this.  What's up with that"	0
This DVD contains all of the original Ben Stiller Show episodes, plus an extra un-aired episode. The show was not only far ahead of its time, but also timeless as is evidenced by Stiller's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the TV series. For anyone who was a fan of the TV series or Stiller's movies, this DVD is a must	1
"I really like Bruce Campbell and his movies like Army of Darkness. But this movie is not in the same league. First of all the plot is slow and boring. Bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at. Instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move. This really hampers the action aspects of the movie. The dialogue aspect is not much better. If you like Bruce, my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the TV episodes of  ""Jack of all trades"" episodes. It is a lot more fun and has the ""real"" Bruce"	0
This DVD possesses some of the best editing and production that I have yet to see in a child development product.Each of the sections (cognitive, physical, and language) is well researched.  It's easy to understand and highly accessible.Just as perfect for a personal library as it is for staff development	1
I can't believe how many people gave this awful movie good reviews. The premise is absurd: namely, that anybody would even THINK about giving up three or six years of their lives to live in a hideous torture cell just so some friend that they barely knew in the first place won't hang - preposterous in itself - for smoking some hash.My advice to Joaquin Phoenix would have been: Sorry, pal, but get a better lawyer.A ridiculous storyline that wasted some fine acting talent.	0
This was my first yoga cd and i found it amazing ... i'm addicted to it. I still cant tell whether its challenging for advanced yogis but as a beginner I really enjoyed it.... it does NOT have all that gibberish spiritual blab on one extreme nor power yoga that seems to really be pseudoyoga on the other extreme .. however this CD is just clear and to the point with good instruction excellent demonstration and fantastic sound tracks.... eric's voice is soothing the instructions are clear and the crew is great. the length is convenient 45 minutes and music is hypnotic. the more i use it the more i feel stronger increase flexibility, breathe more calmly and improve my posture.. in other words dont hesitate just GET IT!!!!!	1
Very pleased with the quality of the product and the timely delivery	1
I saw wirey spindell in theater in new york, and I thought itwas awesome!  I had never heard of it before, but it is a trueendorsement of indie films.  If you love laughing, you'll love this movie.  I loved Devin Matthews-Johnson and Eric Mabius too, they're both so cute	1
"When I first got this disc the other day, it would not play at all. I installed the latest firmware update to my XBOX360 HD drive, and it played. However, it does not play well at all. The video is constantly ""dragging"" or skipping. The audio is fine though. I can't really provide a review of the content since, so far, it is unwatchable.This is the only disc that has given me issues"	0
I have seen many pathetic films in my life. This topped them. Did I rate one star? Sorry- I meant negative 11 stars. It was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It was a total waste of three hours when I could have been sleeping. There was no point. The script and storyline were pathetic. The gore was overdone- too much blood, killing, and the like. It was totally historically inaccurate, and the Civil War scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable. All Civil War veterans are rolling over in their graves. Any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic. One of the abolsute bombs was when Clint Eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar- yet he does not even load it- either time. And somehow, without even aiming the canon, he knocks his 'friend' off his horse. The movie is a failure. F-A-I-L-U-R-E. Crappy. Junky. Just plain DUMB. STUPID. PATHETIC.I am not going to waste any more words on it. Just....whatever you do....save your money. Don't buy it. It's not worth 50 cents	0
I purchased this DVD because it said it was an easier pilates video to do; basically anyone, even beginners, could do it.  I have to disagree.  I started this video and tried to do all of the 5, ten minute sections.  It wasn't completely hard, but definitely challenging.  I am not the most fit person, but also not the most unfit.  I had a harder time because I am just not as limber as you should be to use this pilates video.  I am not saying I wouldn't suggest it, I am just saying it's not definitely for beginners.  However, the instructions are clear and since it's broken up into the five-ten minute sections it gets even lazy people like me to get off the couch and do it	1
I've never been quite a fan of music DVDs.  By that I mean the live stuff.  I much rather be there to experience it then sit at home pretending I'm there.  That's one side of it.  I'm also a huuuuuge Gorillaz fan.  And I have seen them live.  The show to their self titled debut. But don't get me wrong, that doesn't make me biased towards everything they put out.  On the contrary it leaves me to judge them on a higher level because I only expect the best from what they've given.With that said, this has to be literally one of the best music DVDs I have encountered in quite some time.  Don't worry about extras, documentaries, which while would have been nice to show how it was put together, are not here.  Which makes sense since the band itself is very discreet they wouldn't show you all that.The show itself was amazing, and it literally jumps off screen as you watch this, and I recommend you have a decent audio system as well.  The amazing sound quality coupled by the beautiful visuals is astonishingly done well.  The editing and the post production were so well conceived they worked on this like a labour of love and not just another DVD to sell.  From start to end it will leave you speechless.  As you stare in awe at the grandioso that is the Gorillaz, you realise that while at first you figured them to be a fictious band in every aspect, they are quite real and very capable of producing grand music on every level.  You can tell by this by the standing ovation and after the show and after the encore.  Only few bands have ever been able to touch me musically on such a deep level. And to put on such a show which normally you could only catch at the studio over a period of months to produce is a feat in itself.If you want special features videos and documentaries get the 2 other DVDs especially now since they just released their newest one.  Those will fill in all that nicely.  But even if you're not a fan or just a new convert, I highly recommend you own this.  No matter the age, or person you are, (you notice this on the DVD as well) and regardless of what your favourite genre is.  Because they are so massive they can't be contained into one.Thank you Damon and Jamie for such an experience, mates	1
So I finally rented this tripe as I was curious.Gee, making fun of former Soviet block nations/people and rednecks.. now there's some seriously funny stuff..NOT! What's next? A cutting edge comedy on the rap culture?..oops, he already did this with the Ali G show. Gross out potty humour, now that's inventive and we've never seen that before! I also like the lame-o attempt to show how Americans are all anti semitic by putting words into the mouths of those trying to sell him something. These are your imagined demons/foes Sacha and overall your film is pretty boring and about as fresh as a Yakov Smirnoff comedy bit	0
I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars.If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him	0
At first I was skeptical about buying an aging McCartney band tour dvd, even though I have every one, so I bought it. I watched it from start to finish. UNBELIEVABLY SUPERB. The lighting, the energy of the band and the crowd, suprising interviews!! and ole Paul looked pretty good for having passed the 64 year mark! After watching it I felt like I had been there. It is the best one I have seen yet! If you like McCartney, this is him at his best not to mention some great songs you will be surprised to hear!Excellent buy	1
"John Sturges acquires a reputation as a solid director of superior Westerns filled with tense action scenes such as: ""Escape From Fort Bravo,"" ""Bad Day at Black Rock,"" ""Backlash,"" ""Gunfight At The O.K.

He succeeds in one of the most exhilarating opening sequences of all Western movies, when he had McQueen and Brynner riding a hearse up legendary Boot Hill creating a mood and peril that never allow the slightest degree of viewer confusion or ennui... For Sturges, the West is a man's world, and his cool, hard, detached style, emphasizing action, excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier, endorses the point...""The Magnificent Seven"" is derived from Kurosawa's superb ""The Seven Samurai,"" a compelling tale of intimidated and impoverished medieval villagers hiring mercenary warriors to repel bandit ravages... The villagers in this case are Mexicans, plagued beyond all bearing by the activities of bandit Calavera, who always leaves them on tortillas and few beans... Three of them cross the border to offer meager pay and sustenance for any professionally skilled fighting men who will aid them...Yul Brynner is the man, dressed in black, with the luminous dome and the hypnotic Mongolian eyes who portrays the distinctive Chris Adams leader of the seven hired gunmen hired to chase some 'flies from a little Mexican village.' Eli Wallach is memorable as Calvera, chief of the ruthless outlaws... He is greedy and merciless terrorizing without pity the poor peasants...Steve McQueen gives a standout performance as the sardonic gunman ('We deal in lead, friend'), carrying appealing ease and sense of humor to his role as Vin, Brynner's first recruit and second-in-command...Charles Bronson portrays Bernardo O'Reilly, who explains his curious name to Chris, with 'Mexican on one side, Irish on the other--and me in the middle!' Bronson, the strongest face in Western, and with a bit of Mexican in him--cunning face, steady eyes, revealing voice--the character of Bernardo O'Reilly suits him perfectly... This half-breed gunfighter becomes the conscience of the team... Because of his tender paternal instincts, he is adopted by three children who promise him, in case he falls, to bring him, every day, fresh flowers...Robert Vaughn--who was to do nicely on TV in ""The Man from Uncle"" spy spoof-- plays Lee, the 'good gun' with black gloves and nightmares, living in style with no enemies alive...Brad Dexter plays Harry Luck, Brynner's happy friend who returns to join the team convinced of the existence of a large amount of hidden gold...James Coburn makes a big impression as Britt, the expert gunman who can out-draw a gun with his knife-throwing... His looks and vague figure of violence are quite a response for his few talks...Horst Bucholz represents youth, eagerness, and the urge to be proved and sorted out from the boys... He was caught on the road by Rosenda Monteros...Robert J. Wilke is Britt's insisting challenger who swells the ranks of the villains in many Westerns like ""High Noon,"" ""The Far Country,"" and ""Man of the West."" The Magnificent Seven's success spawned three sequels: ""Return of the Seven"" (again starring Yul Brynner), ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"" and, last and least of all, ""The Magnificent Seven Ride."" With a terrific Oscar-Nominated Musical Score by Elmer Bernstein, ""The Magnificent Seven"" remains a richly enjoyable Western, shot on location in Morelos state, Mexico... "	1
This has already been expressed here in the reviews, but just as a reminder one more time..... this DVD is NOT the original version.  The original version has more material and is much better.  Hopefully someday they'll release an Unrated Version the way it was on VHS at one time.	0
"All the great reviews written previously say it all - Anne of Green Gables the movie is a timeless classic of the classic novel. I've been watching this movie since I've been a child, and I still watch it as an adult. A movie like this doesn't need ""special features"" for it to be attractive as a DVD(Although the commentary is great!). Just the fact that no matter how long I keep this and how often I watch this movie, it won't change like VHS does."	1
"The Quiller Memorandum takes place back during the cold war. It represented a time and place in history that was true at that time. It accurately depicts an era that is now gone, that some of us lived through.The movie, by today's standards, is a little disjointed and incomplete.It jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there. Some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60's or 70's in order to get a G or GP rating. As a result of those incomplete or cut scenes, part of the movie makes no sense.  The movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author's original book.The most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score, including Matt Monroe's ""Wednesday's Child"".  I was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later. Perhaps Wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again. Quiller must have gotten lost on his way home!"	0
One of the best new sitcoms in recent years... Up until i got the DVD i had no idea Bob Saget was the narrator... Neil Patrick Harris is very funny as Barney (who names thier kid that these days?)and basically makes the show what it is....... LEGENDARY!	1
"DMX stars as the drug dealer King David, who pops up in the streets again after a long absence. Rolling into the frame in a player's classic - a late 70's Stutz Blackhawk - King David shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life. He quickly reaps what he sows and, mortally wounded, passes all his worldly goods to Paul (David Arquette), a scrambling white would-be writer. King David's estate includes an audio journal of his life, which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken Paul's curiosity. It's the highlights of King David's high life that propel ""Alone."" Like all of Goines's heroes, King David is a scourge on the periphery, and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity. Every life he touches he leaves in ruins - a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit, and DMX signals that motivation with sly hostility. To say that King David is the best part he's ever had is an understatement; he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before.I would recomed this to anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone who like films with a twist"	1
"I originally read the novel (of which I assume most of the other reviewers are unaware) and watched the earlier German film of the same name for a college course entitled ""Memory and Mourning in Post-War Germany.""I'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel. It seems that the director wanted to make a more ""Hollywood"" version of the film, and I think he succeeded. For instance, the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel, and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story.In general, the film has little to do with any of the original versions, and is far inferior"	0
I watched this with some trepidation, and I have to say it was both better and worse than I thought it would be.  It was better because it remained fairly true to the original, in terms of retaining the multiple conflicting story lines and the ambiguous ending.  It was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original, and I found Stone's lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting.A couple of things kept me viewing this DVD.  One was the London setting, which gave me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home towns.  The other was Sharon Stone's rather plucky performance, and the presence of Charlotte Rampling, who has aged into a different kind of beauty.  Morrisey doesn't even come close to filling Michael Douglas's shoes, and it's hard to feel sorry for him at the end.As with the first movie, you are left with the feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made.  The basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one.  However, both movies were quick to abandon Hitchcockian understatement for speeding cars and gratuitous sex.  There's nothing wrong with either of these things, but here they just get in the way	0
Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible	0
Long before the advent of the written word sacred knowledge was handed down through the generations via the vehicles of ritual, song and dance. I have come to believe that the 'old ways' were in many cases the superior mode of transmission. Mere words could never convey the multi-faceted beauty, wonder and awe that can be expressed in sacred song and dance. This point is made crystal clear in this exquisite production of 'Holo Mai Pele.''Holo Mai Pele' is an exciting and exotic multi-media production that I found absoultely engrossing. The director seamlessly moves the viewer back and forth between the preparation of the event in the dance studio, the on-stage performance and beautiful film footage of the enchanting Hawaiian landscape. The on-stage performance is also greatly enhanced by a large screen behind the dancers showing footage of volcanic eruptions, lava flows and lush tropical rainforests. All of this is underscored by an intermitent narrative explaining the history of the hula and the mythological tale of the volcano Goddess Pele and her battle with her youngest sister Hi'iaka. The narrative is the perfect compliment to the production and in no way detracts the viewer from the performance.This DVD serves as both a wonderful introduction to the novice in Hawaiiana and a much needed and revered document to the initiated providing a performance that attests to the power and immense beauty of the hula and its embodiment of the Hawaiian 'Spirit of Aloha.' Truly a sacred visual document to be treasured.	1
The most simple definition of [...] is sexual gratuitousness. Sexual imaging for the sake of turning people on, not providing anything pertinent to the plot.You can't help but get a porno feel while watching Bully. And to think I was supposed to be viewing a film about teenage revenge on the local bully; but it turns out to be a soft porn version of how vapid teenagers waste away their lives with a little killing thrown in.Was it really necessary to show a shot of a girl's crotch while she's driving a car? Was it necessary to have a sex scene or nudity scene or drug scene every 3 minutes? You can't help but see the director as a pervert who is more preoccupied with sex and street cred grittiness than telling a good story. The very first scene is of a guy having phone sex.Several things about this movie other than the [...] made me mad:1. You're planning to kill somebody, then proceed to tell everybody, including the waitress at Pizza Hut what you're planning.2. After you kill, you're so afraid of being caught that you proceed to put more suspicion on yourself by acting VERY strange and telling even MORE people what you did.3. Which makes more sense? To decide to kill a guy because he disrespects you and beats you up occasionally and has sex with your girlfriend, or, to stop hanging out with him completely and stop lending your girlfriend out like a wh-ore. Bobby never put a gun to the guy's head to make him hang out with him, yet murder was the only option?4. I can't believe Mr. Wimp who never fights back can all of a sudden muster the strength to slit a guy's throat while he's staring him blankly in the face begging for his life.5.

"If you follow my reviews, you know that I felt the version of ""Jack the Ripper"" with Michael Caine as Inspector Fred Abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece. Not only was Michael Caine phenomenal in the role, but that version offered convincing speculation to a mystery we don't know and never will. While I respect this version with Johnny Depp, it is more horror oriented. (Michael Caine's version was more historical.) Onto the subject at hand. Some of you may know Jack's 5 victims. (Mary Anne Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Kathy Eadows, and Mary Jane Kelly.) Well, they seem to have a close friendship, and we also get the impression that they share some dangerous secret. (In the Michael Caine version, the 5 victims knew each other, but they were just associates.) Well, of course Jack the Ripper comes into play. One scene is very well done in that while we don't see his face, we do see some disturbing pictures, and we do see him cutting his steak and pouring blood red wine. In comes Depp (Inspector Fred Abberline). It is interesting that while the older Michael Caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role, Johnny Depp looks like his character is living on borrowed time and going to die anyday. But maybe Depp didn't want to just imitate Caine. One thing I had a problem with was that while Caine had some trouble with his superiors, Depp's trouble with his superiors is blown out of proportion. (Without giving the story away, his superiors must have known things that they didn't tell Depp! At least Caine's superiors carried some reason on their side!) You'll probably notice that Depp finds things out much quicker than Caine did. (Probably because Caine's version was 4 hours, while Depp's is only 2.) While Caine was involved with an artist, Depp becomes involved with Mary Jane Kelly. Gradually, Depp discovers things that put together an interesting puzzle. Like Caine did in his version, Depp ironically gets close and almost friendly with the killer. (OF COURSE, DEPP DOES NOT KNOW HE IS TALKING TO THE KILLER.) Well, another problem here is that in the Caine version, we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and was even friendly with Caine. We never really understand here why the killer is friendly and even helpful to Depp. (Jack the Ripper does not have the same mental illness he did in the Caine version.) I will admit that the scenery is well done, the elements of horror are there, and Depp did a good job of not just imitating Michael Caine. And Depp's sergeant Godley does offer some entertainment. But if you saw the Michael Caine version, you will undoubtedly miss the quite probable historical accuracy. If on the other hand, you don't mind the fact that this version is more geared towards horror than history, you'll probably find it a respectable horror movie. SIDE NOTE: Johnny Depp makes Inspector Fred Abberline look like he's going to die anyday. Well, in reality, Fred Abberline lived on for 40 more years after he stopped Jack the Ripper."	1
"The flight into New York had been a long one; but I was gently revived when Kirsten Dunst met me at the airport.  She was to be my escort that night at the Lincoln Center where the President would present me the Distinguished Writer's Cross-the highest award this nation can bestow on an author.  I quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her Mercedes S class sedan to the Waldorf Astoria downtown.""I have to admit that I didn't you who you were until I read STARLESS GRASSLANDS.  I don't mean to embarrass you; but that book changed my life.""I tried to be polite and gracious toward the compliment.  For the remainder of the trip we had a nice conversation while I approved the fluid motion of her hands and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile.  I very much approved of her legs.As I departed the car, Kirsten leaned toward the open door to catch my eyes.""Don't forget.  I'll be by at seven so we can go to the ceremony together.  Please be ready.""I expressed gratitude for her generosity and promised to be waiting for her seven sharp.  The hotel staff greeted me and soon I entered the elevator for a quiet ride to the eighty sixth floor.  As I entered the suite, the steward took my request to have my suit blushed, prepared and returned in a few hours.Finally, a bit of peace.  I poured a small measure of whiskey into a chilled tumbler and then walked over to the large window looking out over the city below.  For a few moments I contemplated the remarks I was to make at this evening's formal ceremonies, then I heard the hushed movement of stocking feet behind me across the room.  I turned around and out of the bedroom to my left in walked Sandy Bullock dressed in a black sheer see through cat suit.""Well, Crabby, aren't you glad to see me?""Before I could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across the floor from the sitting room on the right.  It was Jennifer Aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit.""Sweetheart, don't look at her.  Come here to me.""""Get out!"" screamed Sandy.  ""No, you get out.  It's not fair.  I left Brad for him so I get him!""The two of them stood in angry silence staring at each other for a tense moment.  Then Sandy leapt at Jennifer and instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each other.  It was a ferocious sight as pulled hair, shrieks of pain, and nylon tearing could be heard.  Then almost a quickly as it began, the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room.  Several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body fell to the floor.  Sandy marched back into the room victorious.  I ran to the door of the sitting room only to see Jennifer laid out on the floor out cold, spread eagle and naked.  Before I could think of what to do Sandy tapped me on my shoulder.  I turned around and there Sandy stood.  A little worse for wear.  Trying to catch her breath.  Nude with her torn cat suit draped across her feet.""Forget her.  She won't bother us now.""Sandy brushed the stray hairs out of her face, smiled and stepped out of her nylon costume.  She posed standing and anticipating my admiration.  ""Now I'm all sweaty and warm.  I need a shower.""  Sandy turned her lithe body and walked into the bedroom and into the bathroom beyond.I turned around and wondered what I should do for poor Jennifer still laying unconscious on the floor.  Then I heard Sandy calling.""Crabby, why don't you come and help me?  You could soap up my......""OOPS!!!!  Sorry!!!  Err...just a little fantasy of mine.  I meant to honestly review this movie but my more realistic nature took over.  I swear my pitiful fantasy is actually much better than the story told here.  You see, the cover of this DVD displays Ms. Bullock prominently with her name in big font letters.  But in truth this movie focuses on Tate Donovan as the main character and only on Ms. Bullock as his unlikely love interest.As much as I ""love"" Sandra Bullock, I have to admit her filmography has not been kind to her.  Her best films have been WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY and the much-unappreciated HOPE FLOATS.  Unfortunately for each of these gems are several terrible movies like FIRE ON THE AMAZON, HANGMAN, SPEED 2 and this movie.The plot revolves around two ""losers in love"" who are unappealing both in looks and personality.  Donovan comes across a love potion from a gypsy woman (an unrecognizable Anne Bancroft) and soon both Donovan and Bullock have the most desirable members of the opposite sex at their feet.  All goes well until others find out their secret and Donovan and Bullock discover that their true love is actually between each other.The story is predictable and unfortunately not very funny or all that sweet.  Chances are you can find a copy of this DVD fairly cheap and it is not a bad way to kill some time while you're waiting for your own boyfriend or girlfriend to get off work-or your friends to wake up from their naps-so you can really do something worth wild."	0
"In this cynical day and age, it's truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant (not to mention amazing), but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage?This film works as a eulogy to Arthur ""Killer"" Kane, a synopsis of the Dolls' early years, and a buoy for rock 'n' rollers lost at sea.  It's all things to all people, but it's never boring or condescending.  I would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema, whether they had any knowledge of the Dolls or not, simply because it's a great story, well told, and stands up to repeated viewings."	1
"SOUND OF MUSIC 40th ANNIVERSARY EDITION (Fox) is the latest digital version of this beloved, timeless, film.  The two-disc set features an exceptionally sharp transfer and a rich audio mix but the real treat is the new commentary with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer (this in addition to the late Robert Wise's commentary).  Among the wealth of new treasures in the six hours of extras is on location footage, screen tests (Mia Farrow sings) and a wonderful retrospective documentary ""My Favorite Things: Julie Andrews Remembers.""  Sound of Music is perfect in all departments.  It's also that rare musical in which the music itself is naturally integral to the story and a counterpoint to the Nazi threat of the true-life plot.  Until hi-def DVDs arrive, this is the definitive edition for the library.  Rated: G.  Genre: Musical.  2 Hours, 56 Minutes.  Starring: Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer.  Director: Robert Wise"	1
"We enjoyed this video. The rugby athletes are fun to watch in such a surreal setting. Somehow, these tough, big athletes being posed and shot in various homoerotic poses gives new meaning to ""Sporn""."	1
20 minutes into this movie I was disgusted by the terrible acting and the complete disregard for the book on which is it supposedly based. The actress playing Cleopatra protrays her as petulent, spoiled and immature, whereas in the book one saw Cleopatra as highly astute, regal, and concerned first about her country and its people. In the movie she handed Egypt to Ceasar eagerly, whereas in the book she refused to surrender anything to Rome. Likewise, Dalton portrays Ceasar as a complete ****. Perhaps if this were not based on Margaret George's Memiors of Cleopatra, I would be more kind in my review, but it pains me to think of the years of research wasted because of some second-rate film-maker's idea of good story-telling. At 975 pages the book may be too meaty for most, but if you really want to learn about this queen, read the book instead.	0
A B/W Film Classic.Excellent story and performances from all the stars, perhaps the acting style is a little dated.A very god qulaity transfer to DVD except for one scene that is a little grainy.I will watch this film again and again	1
5 stars to the film itself! Here's a painful study of a woman's descent to lunacy amidst a desolate, uncaring and eventually foreboding backdrop of  industrial waste. The character study is not unlike claustrophobic  Polanski's Repulsion but dwells on Vitti's being consumed by her external  surroundings as opposed to Deneuve's intensive plunge to schizophrenia. The  pace and landscape is virtual Antonioni so it may not appeal to viewers who  are not familiar with the director's works. One of his greatest works  (L'Avventura remains his best to me). The only problem is the DVD transfer.  I've seen the VHS and it has a consistent hue of orange. The DVD, although  sharper and clearer, fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds  and oranges in long shots. For a film that essentially deals with color (it  was Antonioni's first color feature), the transfer was rather clumsy and  careless. The sound is average but leaves a lot of room for improvement.  Why didn't Criterion handle the transfer of this gorgeous film	1
"This is a review of the DVD, not the World Series.  Please save your comments re the Series for the sports blogs.In this day and age, for Major League Baseball to produce a non-anamorphic DVD is absolutely pathetic.  This DVD was made for a widescreen TV (16:9 ratio), but cannot take advantage of it, because it is non-anamorphic, meaning it will not take up the full widescreen.  It has black bars on all four sides.  They may as well have made it full screen instead, with a 4:3 ratio.  Also, in its rush to make a lot of money by getting the DVD out quickly, they decided not to include footage from the season, to show nothing of the Tigers' play-off run, and to provide mostly filler with worthless interviews from players.  (""Gee, was it exciting to be out on the mound!"")I am an avid Cardinals fan, but this DVD was not worth the $14.99 I paid for it.  Major League Baseball, as usual, cheats its fans.  Another lesson they fail to learn from Pro Football"	0
A Night Out with the Backstreet Boys was a romantic dvd. Each of the five guys gets their own solo turns. It also includes songs that are never heard by any bsb fans. It's definitely a great dvd. A must-buy for every bsb lover! Go grab one for yourself if you haven't yet!	1
I was purchasing Rockin' Wheels (the one with the train and fire truck) for my son, and the Truck Adventures came up as a combo deal with a discount if you bought them together.  We borrowed the Rockin' Wheels DVD from the library and he liked it so much, I thought it would be good to have two different ones. However, the Truck Adventures is not as good, and my son doesn't even ask to watch it.  The songs are lame and so is the narrator.  Don't bother	0
I have not gotten into watching the DVD as of yet because I am still watching the reruns on tv, but I know I have no qualms with the dvd. I have bought all the series thus far. It is a collection to have in your library if you are indeed a fan	1

"The only thing that kept this from being ABSOLUTELY predictable was that a dead bad guy did NOT spring back to life.

"A 130-minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and sentimentality, this Swedish import doesn't so much insult your intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the first place, wouldn't know what to do with it if you did have it, and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts. The plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as ""well-worn,"" which seems to be a euphemism for ""shop-worn,"" ""clich�,"" or ""stupefyingly unoriginal."" Here it is (spoilers follow): Daniel, a big-shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health, returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood, takes over and revives the local church choir, heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life-affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness, finds love, finds his inner child, and finally, at the moment of his and his choir's greatest triumph, croaks. A great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program, but Kay Pollack isn't up to it. Instead, in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness, he celebrates, embraces, wallows in the schmaltz, throws it at you until it's dripping off you like oobleck, and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film. Indeed, there's something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last: it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent, albeit of the Ed Wood variety; and while watching it I almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind, as in the Kingsley Amis story about the poet who, at the end of a long and successful career, publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs. (Speaking of whom: ""As It Is In Heaven"" was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars in 2005, after being strewn with similar honors in Sweden, where it was reportedly seen by some TWO MILLION viewers. We're used to this kind of idiocy from the Academy, but what's going on in the country of Strindberg and Bergman? Has someone been putting something in the k�ttbullar?) A standard feature of movies like this (and books like this, if it comes to that--cf. Ayn Rand) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant. AIIIH is no exception. The parade of didactic marionettes includes:-- Daniel's love interest, a ditzy twenty-year-old blonde, who represents the Life Force;-- the humorless, sexually repressed, hypocritical preacher, who represents The Church, which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity, especially in modern Scandinavia;-- the wife-beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates, and then finally locks up and forgives--who represents Violence and What to Do About It;-- the retarded kid whom Daniel insists on letting into the choir, chiefly so that he can become the film's symbol of the Virtues of Inclusiveness and the Deep Human Wisdom of Special People. (Incidentally, it's about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people, in movie after movie, as symbols of purity/goodness/wisdom-beyond-the-ken-of-those-cursed-with-normal-intelligence, or whatever, is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them; it just SEEMS nicer. CAN'T we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being? The only one I can recall seeing is ""Best Boy,"" a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago. Apart from that they've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule, as in ""There's Something About Mary,"" or turned into plaster saints as here.) So, to sum up: save your money and your time, which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of ""The O.C.""  Run, don't walk, from your local art theater if this is the main attraction. And don't forget the moral of the story, rather comforting to me as an expatriate American living in a Europe that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication vis-�-vis the USA: kitsch is global."	0
"Oliver Stone proves to be just as reliable as a social critic as he is a ""historian.""  PLATOON and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY were great films but JFK, though brilliantly made, was a sign that something was off about Stone's mental processes.NATURAL BORN KILLERS could have been a scathing indictment of our media's obsession with violence and decadence...but instead it's just Exhibit A in the indictment, wallowing in the filth it tries to satirize"	0
I had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea.  I don't know if it because I tend to like more horror type movies or what but I was really bored by them.  Each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way.  I know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense.  The movies were violent but nothing one hasn't seen before several times so I am not sure about the shock value of it...I wasn't shocked, disturbed or upset.........just bored	0
The Brood is the lightning in the bottle that director David Cronenberg has never been able to duplicate. While all of his films definitely have his fingerprints all over them, The Brood managed to rise to the top of all of his films. It is absolutely dripping in a sense of dispair and dread. There is a pervading coldness about it - such that you want to wrap up in something warm as you watch it - you want to watch it with the lights on because you're very much afraid of what might be there if you turn off the lights.The film is a psychological thriller wrapped in a slasher flick. It warrants slasher status simply because of the sheer number of onscreen murders that take place. This is a very bloody film!Samantha Eggar is nuts and in a weird clinic for people like her. She is being treated by a creepy Oliver Reed (in one of his better performances). Art Hindle is her ex husband and he's worried about how she is treating their young daughter. After a while that is the least of his worries, as these horribly disfigured and (what the Hell are they?) bizarre little children run around killing all the people that have really ticked off Samantha Eggar.I won't say more, because part of the horror in a Cronenberg film is the pseudo-science that he get you to believe in.Whereas Cronenberg's Videodrome was weird, but not terribly good, The Brood is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen and a guilty pleasure (can I really call it that?) that I choose to subject myself to every so often.Really! What ARE those things?	1
This dvd'd ok. It has the original program in it, and some new features. Although I was a bit dissapointed as the new features, only included about 10 mins of extra buzzer beaters, and the T.Mac ending goes for like 5 mins, and the quality isnt that great	1

I watched this with my parents and didn't like Marlons mouth. Reading these reviews you would think he is a hero or something. He cusses at everything and takes his whole urban hip hop gansta attitude too far. What is cool about that? That whole lifestyle that everyone thinks is so cool is ruining my school AND my neighborhood. The rest of the movie was all right but Marlon made me feel funny with his use of profanity. Sorry, that's just my opinion	0
I had higher expectations when I purchased this DVD.I was not disappointed technically but I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the acting as a whole and with the uneven singing of Rachel York.  She couldn't seem to decide whether she wanted a pop, jazz, or traditional musical theatre sound.  Her voice was all over the place.  Furthermore, I found her character very annoying...she was screechy and not at all vunerable.  I preferred Kathryn Grayson's performance in the movie as she managed to be vunerable, witty, and charming, as well as screechy, demanding, and somewhat tyrannical.  Truly, I could barely watch this entire video and at the end I could have cared less if Fred and Lilli got together.  I think that was the most powerful statement for me.The production was acted (or directed) with a lot of mugging and so much of it was over the top.  Can today's directors PLEASE leave something for the audience to think about and figure out themselves?  Everything need not be a commentary!I wish I had seen Marin Mazzie because I heard she was incredible. Rent this before buying it or better yet do what I did and buy it used.  It hardly cost anything and that is what is it worth	0
This movie isnt worth the time to read this review. It sucks and I'm a big Trinity fan. My advice is keep searchin	0
I am a fan of DBZ, I am a fan of Goten, I think Hercule is funny and I think #18 is hot. Yet this movie sucked! It was missing what makes DBZ so great: lots of action and a great plot. Broly is overused and this completely ruins him. Like most DBZ movies, it doesn't fit into the timeline. If we worked it in, then Goten and Trunks would only be a matter of hours away from using the Fusion technique. Had this movie taken place after then, the fight would be a lot more interesting.In short, if you want to see every DBZ movie, then rent it. If you insist on collecting the whole series, wait until Movie Collection #4 comes out	0
Most people that like Wes Anderson's films are rabid fanatics, and I'm no exception, so when the chance came to buy his first feature-length film for $7, I snapped it up. If you enjoyed Life Aquatic or The Royal Tenenbaums, you'll enjoy this, on some levels, too. Many of Anderson's classy touches are already in evidence in this film. The story is fun, and the characters are well-developed. Yeah, pretty much buy it if you like the Wilson brothers or Wes Anderson. The high point of the movie is certainly Luke Wilson's character, masterfully done even in his first role.	1
I am convinced you have to be one of three things to enjoy this film: male, born before 1935, or a huge Monroe fan smitten with anything she ever put out. Marilyn is so annoying in this I wanted to smack her, and Tom Ewell's character is equally a jerk. I am not sure why this movie was supposed to be funny. Is adultery funny? Not really. I don't mean to sound so conservative, in fact I'm quite the opposite, I'm pretty liberal, which may be why this movie bothered me so much. It is very sexist and dated and Monroe's usual portray of the harmless, stupid, breathy blonde bimbo so eager to please isn't very empowering to young women. The character she portrays has no name, is simply titled 'The Girl' a female puppet manufactured for pleasure. The jokes are dated and fall flat, no longer funny to modern society. I think 'The Seven Year Itch' is one of the most overrated 'classics' ever but what can I say, my 84 year-old grandmother enjoyed it. Maybe she was just nostalgic for the '50s. A much better Monroe comedy is 'Some Like It Hot' where she is less annoying and the humor still resonates to this day	0
Just received this as a gift from the Easter Bunny, and watched half the episodes today without one skip, hiccup or any other problem of any kind. If you're a fan of the show, these DVDs are a must have, period. Relive the good old days with the best show on television and order these--and all the other seasons--now!	1
 Great movie and the movie a family can set and enjoy and not worry about the next word or scene may hold	1
I love Cinderella and try to see them live whenever they're in town, but the sound on this DVD is just horrible.  Didn't anyone listen to it before releasing it? The video quality is fair.  They sure didn't spend a lot of money on production here.  I was very disappointed and wish I could get my money back	0
"beware! this is not the tv series as described by the first reviewer (not the reviewer's fault). this is instead, the movie version of ""return to treasure Island"", and the tv version is by a different distributor"	1
&quot;Monkey Business&quot; looks pretty good on DVD 50 years later.  The restoration comparison on the DVD shows the change the restoration brought, a bit darkly tinted, and more defined.  The wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout.  Marilyn Monroe who is the star on the DVD box has more of a supporting role here.  She is great as the secretary Lois Laurel who shows up early because the boss doesn't like her punctuation.  Cary Grant as the addled Professor Barnaby Fulton turns in a great journeyman performance, getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth.  His driving sequence with Monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks!  Ginger Rogers as wife Edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth.  If all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions, it'd be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings.  Hugh Marlowe as the straight-laced attorney Hank Entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy Indian game.  Oscar winner Charles Coburn (1943, The More the Merrier) does a great job of appreciating Monroe's assets as Oliver Oxly, the CEO.  Kathleen Freeman as Mrs. Brannigan gives a fine performance. The DVD offers perviews of many Monroe films.  This is a great little piece of cinematic history.  Turn back the clock &amp; enjoy	1
Nothing original here.  Nothing overly humourous.  Overall pretty bland in my opinion.  The only part I thought was really worth watching was when the casket exploded at the end. 	0
"I should have left this review a long time ago. I could kick myself for buying it, thinking it was a film, not a religous object. If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals, you risk being burned at the stake, an act of love to purify your soul. This film,as a film, disregarding the topic, is a dog. A cheap ""B"" grade, blood spurting, flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles. I could go on for an hour, but won't bother"	0

"Instead of reviewing the content, my review is based more on the DVD Presentation.Pros: The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is just excellent, with great separation of instrument up front and in back and the great use of surrounds for more that just audience cheering. Sound is only second to the Shakira Unplugged Dvd.Cons: Who ever mastered this DVD must be living in 1997. This concert was recorded in HD and is usually shown on MTV HD network. The big mistake being that the concert is not Anamorphic(Enhanced for 16x9 Televisions). Sure the majority will not care, but for those of you who own HD monitors, you will see the negative in losing that extra resolution and the fact that you have to manually zoom in.Second negative being that if you want to start the concert from a specific song, you have to start the concert from the beginning and skip ahead. Because if you try to start from the ""Song Selection"" menu, it will take you back to the menu every time the song you selected ends. Overall a great concert, but a disappointing DVD presentation"	1
"The problem with this film is I read the book.  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent.  The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example.  Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, ""HEY, don't forget the book!""  But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit.  ""Be Cool"" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made.  A few laughs are provided.  A couple ironic scenes show up, but there's too little to sustain a full-length feature.  Basically, the project is a disservice to everyone involved.  Some of the characters are so thin--face it--poor Christina Milian as Linda Moon, is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings--a clich�.  The Rock does the best he can but again, `He's a gay bodyguard;' he's the  brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a Raji, his boss [Vince Vaughn], who, in the book, is far more sinister--but in the film he's an idiot.  Of course Chili is Chili. Travolta does a very nice job, and Chili's obviously the smartest guy in the room.  Uma Thruman's performance is, well, not funny--not serious, not intense--not much-- at best, she made me shrug.  I do like what Harvey Keitel did with Nick Carr, but there's just not enough, and all the negatives reflect completely on the director.  Enough said there.My advice, watch `Get Shorty'again, or read `Be Cool.'"	0
No reviews for this video as the disk I have got has nothing recorded on it and it has a flat and rough gray inside surface with no silver surface of recorded movie and when inserted into the player a message of No Disk is displayed. As the shipping cost is to be born by the buyer in case a DVD is defective and in my case the shipping cost is much more than the DVD as i have to ship in from India. So I can just throw it in the garbage bin and suggest you guys that kindly watch out for this disk.                              	0
Good lord, but this was awful. Normally A&amp;E makes a mean costume drama, but /Benedict Arnold/ stank like rotting poultry.  The dialogue was stilted and incredibly unrealistic, the battle scenes were rendered in clunky slo-mo to cover up the lack of extras, and the costumes appeared to have been rented from a cheap Halloween shop (with the exception of the military uniforms, especially the Continentals', which were accurate). Aidan Quinn chewed the scenery into pulp and used &quot;historical voice&quot; (the lame semi-British accent affected by actors in costume drama).  Kelsey Grammer was pretty darn good as Washington, but his lines were horrid, horrid stuff ripped from the pages of a grade-school history text. Worst of all were the simpering John Andre and Peggy Arnold, whose rose-garden courtship scene was laughably bad.  In short, don't even bother to rent this. It's an hour and a half of your life that would be better spent cleaning the house or napping	0
I love death cab. I saw on degrassi, when an interviewer asks ashley and craig (in the interview that they leeave spinner and marco out of) they say that they are influenced by DCFC, I started watching degrassi when i heard kevin smith was on 3 episodes. get this dvd....it is sooooooo good, i want plans too..	1
"Leary is a hack. He wasn't ""influenced"" by Bill Hicks, he STOLE material. That makes him a hack. How can you Leary fans argue with the definition of the word hack? Take it up with Webster's Dictionary. The exact bits Leary stole are described in the book AMERICAN SCREAM on pages 201-202. Bill Hicks was incensed when he heard Leary's tape. On behalf of Bill's memory, give credit to the original. "	0
This is one of the great biopic films ever made.  More often than not, film biopics are too rushed.  They try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives, and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives.  This is not one of those films.  It just covers Woody Guthrie's adult life, from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer, and his passionate defense of the working man.  The look of the film is deliberate, in that it's washed out.  The hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film.  They're really lively, where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves.  The film has a real genuine feel to it, like you're actually watching real people.  David Carradine is amazing as Woody Guthrie.  He makes you think you're actually watching Woody himself.  He did his own singing and stuntwork on the film.  Ronny Cox is excellent as well, and he does his own singing too (remember, Cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in Deliverance).  Randy Quaid and Melinda Dillon offer great supporting roles as well.  This is a fabulous film, and it feels short at 2 1/2 hours.      	1
the crappiest DVD release ever! video and audio quality sucks! this is not a Jet Li movie. buyer's beware! i'll give this a negative rating	0
this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television.NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENTA song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.    	0
why ? because it has good sound dts hd 5.1 master lossless audio the picture quality will not blow you away it just seams flat and washed out and this just isnt a good movie i like tim burton and mark wahlberg but this movie was done wright the first tim	0
"I idiotilcy got this DVD because of Colin Firth, and, as you can see, it sucks. BTW, this is not ""Prasadjonnalagadda"" but rather his daughter, he just comes to buy crap, but NEVER reads the reviwes. Anyways, I had better time watching a syndicated Simpsons' episode than watching this bomb. At first, I thought that this movie might've had some potential because of the suberb stars: Colin Firth and Minnie Driver ( Good Will Hunting, Won an Oscar for it) I did not yet know Heather Grahm, but after this movie, I hate her NOW! I will admit, she was alright up until she got drunk in the car. That. Was. Annying beyond reason.  Other than that, the film's set up is absolutly horrible, starting off with Colin coming to a town just because it's called Hope? And falling in love with someone only after a couple of days? And there is also the horrible music that doesn't fit the mood at all whenever they play at the scene. Pepole, I originnaly gave this a 2 star for Colin and Minnie, but Heather is responsible for everything else."	0
"I think that anyone who believes this movie to be ""hilarious"" or Hudson's performance ""overrated"" and ""over-the-top"" in her singing just doesn't like musicals.  Or perhaps doesn't like an all black cast (I am not black) or is too young to understand the 60's world of music and payola and backstabbing.  While touted to be similar to the experiences suffered by The Supremes with Diana Ross as its lead singer, it is close in some aspects and totally far away in others.  The key words here are ""loosely based"" on the story of the Supremes.  Why people, including Ross herself don't get that is beyond me!Over the top? If anyone saw the original play with Jennifer Holliday (I did see it) then you don't know the meaning of over the top.  That character was supposed to be that way and Hudson did a wonderful job of that.  Her performance overrated?  Hogwash!  She deserved all the accolades she received as a novice actress. Murphy did one of his best acting jobs ever! Beyonce's performance was good but not great.  This was in part because her character while prominent was not the focus of the movie nor was it of the play. This was Beyonce's best acting performance thus far though she still needs some work and the ""right"" role.  This was not the right role for her in my opinion.  Hudson's character is the main and central character which puzzles me for the ""supporting actress"" win.  Though as lead actress she probably would have lost.You people out there, don't take my word for this movie's greatness and take on a true part of history even if it was ""white-washed,"" no pun intended.  Or don't think its a bad movie like some other critics here.  YOU MUST JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.  I hope and think  that you won't be disappointed. There are some more than subtle references to The Supremes and Diana Ross especially in some of the costumes, Beyonce's images and album covers (CD covers for you youngsters)BUT only die hard fans of the Supremes and people who were there at that time would know that.  ENJOY"	1
"The only reason to rent this film is so that you can laugh at the stupidity of it. The writing was terrible, the plot so unrealistic, and the ""special effects"" horrible. This is by far the cheesiest and dumbest film ever made. Why Haley Mills agreed to star in it is beyond me."	0
"A wonderful movie which deserved all the awards which were bestowed upon it.  It is refreshing to view great movies with wonderful stories minus bad language and nudity.  As a big fan of Greer Garson, I must comment on Jane Bedinger's review in which she claimed that Ms. Garson was having an ""affair"" with the actor who played her son.  Ms. Garson fell in love with and married Richard Ney about a year after the movie was made.  I don't see how Ms. Bedinger could consider this an ""affair"".  "	1
"I've always been a fan of Roger Moore's James Bond, but what I've discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his Bond movies were, like, actually good.  ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" is not one of them.  Oh, sure, it's fun -- almost ALL of the Bond flicks are fun -- but it's basically just a kid's movie, and that's not necessarily a good thing.(1)  Stromberg is a lame villain.  Yes, his underwater lair is well-designed, but it's silly.  Not as silly as that ice palace in ""Die Another Day,"" but pretty silly.(2)  Barbara Bach is one of the very worst Bond girls.  She's not an ugly woman, to be sure, but she was a terrible actress; she sounds like she's reading -- poorly -- from a cue card in ever single scene she's in.(3)  Jaws is a stupid character.  Having metal teeth wouldn't actually make you capable of biting through metal.  The metal you were biting would resist, and you'd end up just tearing up your gums.  I don't expect realism from 007 movies, but I also expect them to not be outright idiotic.  (That said, Jaws is effectively used, and Richard Kiel was excellent in the role.)(4)  The disco score is terrible.  TERRIBLE.(5)  The plot is nothing more than a rehash of ""you Only Live Twice,"" but on the ocean rather than in space.  Certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies!  Embarrassing.I love Bond, but this is not one of the highlights.The DVD is good, with a couple of fine documentaries, but the commentary track grates, because the director and other commentators spend WAY too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did.  Even if that were true, it'd be annoying"	0

"I encourage anyone who enjoys Superman and wants to relive a bit of your childhood in fun-filled nostalgia, to purchase the entire series of the ""Adventures of Superman"" (played by George Reeves); the full set of all the episodes consists of 12 packed DVD's (I got mine all at once in a 3-pack collection, saving a little $$).  This is your chance to view the ENTIRE Superman TV series, from the first episode to the last (prematurely ending with the death of George Reeves)"	1
This movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  As a huge Colin Firth fan originally from a small town in Vermont, I thought that no matter what I had heard about the film I would enjoy it.  Unfortunately,  I was wrong.      The main problem of the film was characterization.  There were oftentimes no motivations or explanations whatsoever for the character's actions.  One minute, the small town girl played by Heather Graham is working at a nursing home, then she's downing alcohol, then she's jumping around naked for absolutely no apparent reason (in fact, she doesn't even seem drunk), and all this entices the character Colin Firth to jump into bed with her.  I think the Heather Graham character is supposed to be quirky, but because of the script and the way the film is cut, she comes off as schitsophrenic and unlikable.  Then suddenly they are in a serious relationship which Colin dives into wholeheartedly even though he is supposed to be recovering from a breakup with his fiance (and this is no rebound relationship).  Basically, the movie continues along this vein, with Minnie Driver showing up as the dark-haired British ex-fiance who you can't see ever having had a relationship with Colin (both actors are better in the much superior movie Circle of Friends).  In any case, there are many more unexplained actions and wierd breakups/get back togethers before the movie thankfully ends.    Additionally, the setting is completely misused, beginning with the sign that says more than 18,000 people live in Hope.  In New England, that does not classify as a small town.  They could have used the autumn setting and American-ness of the people as restorative to the Colin character.  The suggestion of that is there, but it is never demonstrated - instead, they go to a spot that is supposed to be nice and the Heather Graham character downs a bottle of booze, and Colin Firth's character has no real explanation or feeling in his portraits of the town's people.  Although the hotel owners are fun, if unrealistic, the mayor has been written as if he were a cartoon character.     Finally, I don't neccessarily blame the actors for this awful movie, with the wierd cutting, it may have seemed like a good idea at the time.  I think Colin Firth does his best at being an ambigious, but still likeable guy.  Heather Graham, aside from not coming off as a small town girl at all, has absolutely nothing to work with, so you can't even blame her for the horrendous character she has.  And everyone else, including Minnie Driver, is a complete caricature, although Minnie Driver incites some of the few amusing moments in the film.    I feel bad to judge this movie so harshly, but it is unneccessarily bad, and I had been hoping for something at least fun.  These actors all have much better movies out there.	0
"Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house) and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon commited suicide. Only four girls remain.The act which Cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum. Four of the Lisbon's neighbors, four young boys, suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got hold of Cecilia's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she thought she would fly.With their youngest sister gone, the remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding themselves further from the outside world. When school starts again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The usual profuse apology to the mention of the word ""death"" and the like.Trip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she's not interested. But after his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip's request, knowing nothing but Trip's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew.After Trip explains the situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke.They then drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow, but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence.The girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home. Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides.Ultimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to sum up the story in a few lines (such as ""Follow the lives of the Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation."") the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie, they should've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences. The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to, perhaps, people who like movies such as ""Elizabethtown"" which Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future"	0
"Well, i just got done watching this movie and actually went out of my way to write this review.  Truthfully, i didn't catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around the house and could  care less about what happend.  The trailers and the DVD cover of this movie is very misleading.  One would think that they are going to see something from a great genre of horror movies about zombies and a group of people doing whatever it takes to survive.  I'm a big fan of Romero movies and loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would be a cool australian take-off.  I couldn't be more wrong.  Nothing in the movie makes sense from the start.  The entire movie is over the top starting with the actors.  Everybody has entirely too much dialogue except for the main character who hardly says two words during the entire movie.  She looks lost, confused, and out of her league.  Other characters include a local pilot and his pregnant girlfriend, a ""wacky"" police sgt with his asthmatic partner, the bait & tackle clerk who never screams during the entire movie, and our heroin character who won the local beauty contest.The movie takes place in a small town in austrialia somewhere.  When meteors strike the earth (and slam into people), it unleashes a germ which causes people to become zombies.  Our main characters all meet up and try to survive.  However, aliens are involved so the story goes from a survival story to beams of light dressed in capes and floating around right in the middle of a big battle.  The viewer is left to wonder what's going on at first, but as the dialogue and story become unbearably bad, you find yourself not caring as the minutes tick by.  I honestly couldn't tell you much else because it's just so terrible that I just simply couldn't take a minute more.  Bad acting, bad dialogue, over the top effects, and some of the worst camera work i've ever seen.  This movie apparently took two years to make... imagine if they only had one???Another portion of this movie that makes me ill is the bait & tackle charater.  He shows up out of nowhere and saves the heroin's life like a bad clint eastwood impression (with big hat covering his eyes to boot).  Then, he walks away.  When he appears again, he's able to do these matrix style backflips (digging his ""spurs"" into the wall/ceiling) and making two pistols jump over his back and land directly into his hands.  Does this guy ever miss?  What do you think?  He manages to kill about 50 zombies with his two pistols while hanging from the wall upside down.  Not bad for a bait and tackle salesman living in the backwoods of australia!  If you dig the gore, this one is ok... but again, wayyyy over the top.  I had no idea that one bullet from a .45 could blow someone in half.  Our characters are so clueless that it actually takes them 3/4 of the movie to figure out how to shoot them in the head.  I personally counted several scenes where a character is shooting a police revolver and somehow manages to get 13 shots out of a 6 shooter.  Someone get NASA on the phone and explain how you can do that because i just don't get it.  The absolutely worst part of this movie, without a doubt, is the music.  It never stops!  There's never a scene without music for some reason!  And it just makes what you're watching seem absolutely cheesy!  It reminded me of a 1950's serial/pirate swashbuckling kind of thing with guys swinging on ropes and jumping across a gorge kind of thing.  The soundtrack is truly the worst i've ever heard with extra cheese included.  Did they use up their budget on the effects?  Probably!  I found myself wishing that i could mute the music during the film!  If you're a fan of good monster / zombie movies, i beg you to pass this one by and keep on moving.  It doesn't make sense, the story is amazingly weak, the plot is... well, there isn't one... you'll wish you could have your 2 hours back.  I know i do!!!"	0

This was a very interesting movie.  A friend told me to watch this movie after I told him that I really liked the movie The Skeleton Key.  I think I liked The Skeleton Key better... but this was still a really good movie.  There are a few scenes with nudity in it.  Not a movie for the youngsters. We had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end.  A good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing	1

"When we watched this remake of Brian's Song, it was not by design. We had requested the 1971 version from Netflix, but the DVD was damaged in the mail and they resent the 2001 remake by mistake. But instead of sending it back again, we thought ""what the hec, let's give it a chance."" While we didn't expect it to live up to the beloved original, nothing could prepare us for how god-awful it was. So when we saw all the stars given to this remake, we were utterly mystified. Other than Mekhi Phifer's performance, which was pretty good, it was a joke. Sean's Maher's Brian Piccolo was a caricature; cartoony and over-the-top obnoxious. Maybe they had intended to cast Jim Carrey in the role but he was busy. Instead, they got Maher to do a Jim Carrey impersonation.  James Caan portrayed Piccolo as this outgoing, wise-cracking guy, but he was human and believable -- not a clown. And those football scenes. They looked ridiculous. At least in the original they used real game footage, which gave a real gritty sense of being in a stadium -- not at a high school or some sound stage. Even though the original was a TV movie, the performances, scenarios and dialog were well done, believable, touching, heartwrenching. If you watch it now is it dated? Of course, but there's nothing wrong with that. It is current to the time it depicts. But this remake reminds us of a very bad, melodramatic after-school special. Really, it was so bad I can't find adequate words to describe it"	0
"I feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated. There were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted, but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly (ex. one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static). The costumes were well selected, but I felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard (you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face). This version follows the book well, though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the ""drink me"" bottle. I also felt that the British accents in the movie enhanced the film. I recomend this to fans and people who aren't overly critical of films"	1
Truly his greatest film I have seen thus far.  Not only is one taken in by this movie, but it allows one to forget that it's filmed in black and white.  The boy, Elvis, of course, is even more beautiful in KING CREOLE.  Which leads me to believe he believed in his work for this picture.  The soundtrack is admirable.  He delivered it with such effervescence, such pride.  One can't help but fall in love with him and this movie. Too bad Elvis was so loyal to Col. Parker.  He could have been the great dramatic actor he had always wanted to be.  This film certainly promised it	1
"David Cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of Stephen King's novel, and Christopher Walken was superb in his portrayal of Johnny Smith (no middle initial).  The supporting cast added to the film:  Martin Sheen was a convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role.This movie (and the book) are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be true science fiction.  Smith's character was in a coma for several years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities.  There is nothing supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people.This movie is not completely faithful to the movie.  Some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104 minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel.  Some of the changes add moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first.  I do question the need for some of the changes -- I don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I considered weaker parts of the movie).True science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character.  Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but they were not absent either.  As a result, the story (both book and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy.This movie is not for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced).  The R rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character.  (Cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies, like ""Scanners"", ""Videodrome"", and the 1986 remake of ""The Fly""; this movie had him more subdued, but very effective.)Besides the R-rating, there are aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie) that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister.  This is because of its dependence on situation ethics.  Adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith because of the situations.  In spite of these misgivings, I think this was an excellent movie.  I think it was worthy of several awards, such as acting nominations for Walken and Sheen, for adapted screenplay, and for best picture. "	1
"Clearly this Movie was never intended as High Art, or even a Zombie Gore Fest, although Hyped as such, so it`s probably a bit unfair and easy to take Shots at it, however I think it fails on it own terms.*** Many Spoilers To Follow ***   Stop Here if you plan to view the entire Film.  The Premise: A group of stupid Eco Terrorists raid a research facility in London, even though warned by a researcher, release some highly agitated  but otherwise normal looking chimps who then attack and infect them with a  fast acting ( within Seconds ) virus that transforms them into insane, red-eyed murderous really fast creatures who attack and infect other normal humans through bites and even scratches. One drop of their saliva or blood can infect you.  The Plague is let lose ...The  Hero: Cut to a skinny kid of about 110 pounds with a dopey beard laying naked on a hospital bed, it`s 28 days later and he wakes up, but no one's there. He then wanders around an empty London, in hospital scrubs, looking confused,  yelling "" HELLO !! "" , "" HELLO !! ""There are no bodies outside, and nothing that looks like the remains of one. There are almost 15 Million people in Metropolitan London.  Where did they go I asked myself  ? The Supporting Cast: He then wanders into a Church, and finds it full of what looks like sleeping people, he yells "" Hello !! ""at which time some start screaming and rush at him, in the close-up it`s clear they have Turned and he slugs the Creature-Priest Thing  with his bag of Coke Cans. He gets out , more Stuff Happens, eventually  he meets smart and tough Selena (Naomie Harris) armed with a matchete and Mark (Noah Huntley), armed with a steel bar, who have avoided infection and explain the situation to the dim whitted  Hero, who turns out to be a Bicycle Messager Boy who lives with Mum and Dad. Seems the Creatures come out mostly at Night. Mostly. Hero insists on going Home, Mark & Selena tag along. We find his very middle class Mum & Dad peacefully dead in bed from an overdose of Booze and Pills. Guess they could not live in a World Without Telly... More talk and moaning and tears from Hero who very unwisely lights a candle at night which naturally draws an attack by some Nasties, more fighting, bad guys are killed by Selena and Mark while Hero cowers on floor. Mark gets infected, denies it,  but is chopped by Selena who "" can see it in his eyes "". Damm Girl!  if I`m ever in a Zombie Movie I want you along !Day 2 comes, the pair then wander aimlessly though London chatting away about everything but how to deal with the threat and survival  and at this point I start thinking; wouldn`t it be a good idea to get some Guns ?  preferably full auto, with a lot of Ammo. I mean, although the Creatures are fast, they are stupid, don`t run in packs and make a lot of noise and can be killed and stay dead. Police Stations and Military bases are all over London,  probably deserted , and filled with Guns....but this doesn`t seem to occur to our wandering charactors who trust to a Baseball Bat & Machette which you must get close  to use....emmmm.  I start squirming a bit in the seat, and for the first time look at my watch, but it`s still kind of ok. So far, it`s still a tight, well made interesting film, with the bloody action well filmed and important to the story line, and mostly believeable in it`s own low buget Post Apocolypitcal setting with taut dialoge that holds my interest.  Maybe there a reason the Hero is cast as Stupid, or will he grow and learn through experience ?,  maybe, but it better be soon because we are almost 30 minitues into the Film, and it`s getting real hard to identify with him. Or care.The Suporting Cast 2 :  Night Falls. Our pair see flashing lights on the top of a High Rise, much action ensues, they find more survivors, just a average working type Dad Taxi Driver and his young daughter. More Talk, seems they are out of water and there is a radio broadcast giving direction to go North where the Army ( who usually have Guns )  has set up a Secure Area. Works for me.After some debate on whether it better to stay where they are, isolated, in fact trapped on top of a Building,  with no water or power or food or real weapons until overrun by Zombies, or travel North to safety , in Daylight and safety ( remember, the Monsters don`t operate in daylight ) this Group of Dopes reluctantaly decide to go North, in a taxi, with no guns..( remember Rule # 3 of Zombie Films: Gun Are Good )..and at this Point In Time this heretofore good film starts to move rapidly downhill in believablity.The Journey of the Dumb: Piling into Dad`s hack, loaded with junk as if going on a Brighton Holiday, with all, even tough Selena giggling and laughing, off they go. When faced with the choice of driving through a Dark tunnel , where it is obvious that they could be trapped and killed, or another safer route, they naturally chose the Tunnel. Stuff Happens.Stopping to get gas, the Hero wanders alone into a dark, confined space for no real reason, armed only with a Baseball Bat. More stuff happens.Stopping for the night, they decide that a picturesque, open field with a few low stones is a great spot and preceed to ......You Guessed It!   Start a Really Big Fire and go to sleep with no one on guard. I`m not making this up folks..!!   Nothing Happens. However they do get to see a Family of White and Black horses running free, and it`s clear that we are no longer watching a Horror / Action Film, with some internal logic but a trite  "" Message Film "" .They reach the Army Blockade, but no one is there, in spite of dead everywhere, they proceed to split up and wander around this perfect ambush site for a look see.  More stuff Happens.After this, the stupid illogical stuff comes fast so this is a good stopping point. At the end we learn from the crazy and sadistic Army Major ( aren`t they all though ) that the Goon`s can`t farm or feed and will likely starve because of it. Think about that one. We also learn that the Virus is contact borne, NOT Airborne, think hard about that one Dudes !  Since it started in one local it`s very unlikly to have spread thoughout England in 28 days....big Plot holes, dumb ending, 110 pound Stupid Hero becomes Arnold The Terminator in 10 mintues. Girls decide it`s far better to die a gruesom death then Put Out and Lose Their Honor  to what looks like a bunch of boy scouts in Cammos, who are their only protection... really dumb stuff after an excellent start.  Sad....this was a really superior film  for the first 20 mintues."	0
This movie has the best opening scene ever!  It's amazing how great they made this movie considering the first one was only eh...Highly recommended	1
"Interestingly, this pro-apartheid film was produced and written by Jack Abramoff, now famous for pleading guilty to fraud and tax evasion in the course of orchestating the biggest American congressional corruption scandal in a generation.Yes the same man who bribed over 60 congressmen and senators, robbed several native american tribes blind, tried to take out life insurance policies on tribal elders with himself as the beneficiary, and called the Choctaw tribal council ""Monkeys"" and ""troglodytes"", had an interesting earlier career.   He was disqualified from the student government election in  his Beverly Hills elementary school for exceeding spending limits.He took over the young republican movement in college with his schoolmates including Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, and longtime republican insider Grover Norquist.  But more relevant to this movie, well into the 1990's while actively working in the Hollywood film industry he worked both covertly and overtly to support the racist whites only Apartheid Goverment of the old South Africa, and to oppose and discredit Nelson Mandela and the ANC's struggle for majority rule and racial equality.During this period, he conceived this piece of bizarre propoganda, paid for by the Apartheid government in the old South Africa, equating the struggle for black liberation in South Africa with communism and the Soviet Union, and openly placing his sympathies with the racist minority Afrikkaner government.The hero of the film is based on the many mercenaries, or so called soldiers of fortune, as they are called in their trade magazine which like the makers of this film, were also enthusiastic about private killers being hired to murder activists fighting against apartheid.An amazing historical anomoly, this piece has even more significance in the wake of the currently unfolding scandal which promises to be one of the largest in history, involving bribery,favors, protection of sweatshops (in US colonies where women are forced into having abortions), fraud, the chritian coalition, pitting one tribe against another to essentially steal money from native america, and possibly the gangland style murder of his former business partner, the owner of Sun Cruises, when he complained about being defrauded in the sale of his cruise line.My advice, buy it used for historical purposes, not new.  This guy has made more than enough money off the backs of the American people.   Let's not forget how fear of communism was used to justify murder, racial segregation, perversion of the constitution, police state style abuses of civil rights,  and many other crimes against humanity.  Let's learn the lessons of history and preserve what is good about the USA.  Let this movie be a record of the power of Hollywood to either perpetuate lies that are used to kill and abuse people, or to turn away from evil and tell the truth.  Let's make a different legacy this time around"	0
"""Lagaan"" is a masterpiece.   The setting, the music, the full range of singing, the craving for love, - all provide stimulating background for the depth of a plot which portrays a strong young man, with failth in himself, and his refusal to be ground under by external forces beyond his control. You, the reader, must step up to the wicket, sooner than you may realize, and defend the slim sticks of your belief in defense of the innate dignity of mankind."	1
I saw this movie and I found it both shocking and choking. It displays children as young as 4 years old smoking cigarettes! Did the filmmakers take into account the damage tobacco could have done to these child stars? (Yes, the cigarettes and the smoke were real, not CG.) I think they should have omitted such scenes from the script, because it displays a behavior that's not only illegal in several countries, but also threatening to both society and childhood. No matter what the other reviewers thought about the movie, I give it a disgusting 1, and this is the last movie I ever watch that depicts smoking children. To those that haven't yet watched this movie, please DON'T WATCH IT, unless you want cancer to win the health wars.And here I hand out a lesson for every active or aspiring moviemaker: if you want to depict smoking children, use COMPUTER GRAPHICS instead of the REAL THING	0
"This is a great movie that everyone should see. I'm a Conservative and so are all of my friends and they love this movie. We don't see this movies as a ""Republicans are Bad movie"" thats dumb. This movie is just what a movie should be, funny and entertaining. We all LOVE the songs because they are not only great, but true too"	1
"When people talk about buddy-buddy films this one gets overlooked.This was a refreshing break from the Eastwood mold,stepping down from the Dirty Harry altar, to switch sides of the law or God(as a preacher).This has a loaded cast, Clint Eastwood, Jeff Bridges(Oscar nominee/robbed)to George Kennedy, as another evil meanie.The oddball teaming of Eastwood and Bridges seals the movie as an enjoyable romp, where cross-dressing,wearing disguises and other stuff plays second-hand to the relationship which is supposed to be mentor/rookie but becomes Laurel/Hardy too often.The story itself wanders off in various directions until it comes home with unexpected sadness, marking the arrival of the versatile Bridges.Like ""Collateral,"" where Cruise lets Jamie Foxx run with the movie, Eastwood generously let Bridges vamp for effect. Such a free-wheelin' script has not hit the screen in a long while."	1
This one is just plain awful!!   It's a bunch of Hollywood brats being histrionic. 	0
Phillip Hoffman is searching for purity.  Unfortunately his play has been purchased by a wild Hollywood movie crew, and they are off and shooting in Waterford, Vermont because Main Street is already there.  It is cheaper than building a set.  Then the town folks, New Englanders, dry and pragmatic, mingle with Hollywood slime balls, daft, smooth-talking director, William H. Macy and screen idol, young girl chasing, Alex Baldwin. Sarah J. Parker of Sex in the City fame plays the nymphomaniac actress bedding everyone in sight.  Small town smart girl Rebecca Pigeon and writer Hoffman make the necessary changes in the script and then they fall in love. A scandal threatens the shoot and somebody forgets the mayor's dinner party.  There is plenty of manic fun here.  I recommend for a good laugh. Also, is it just me or is William H. Macy the best actor in the world	1
Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious & saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works.I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast.  But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.  And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting.  Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping.  Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of  the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief.  But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production.I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable.  The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance.  If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator.  It falls a bit short of that, however.Finally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery.  They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept.  Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war.  The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book.The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War.  The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg.  C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie.Still and all, the film is very watchable.  And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film	1
"I waited over 30 years to see this film, and now that I have -- I'm glad I waited that long.  Its glaring defects might not have been so obvious to me 30 years ago.  Nicholas, Alexandra, their daughters, their son, the people surrounding them -- not only are they not fictional, but thanks to the era in which they lived, they were photographed, we know what they actually looked like.  So who on earth did the casting?!  It was impossible to tell one Grand Duchess from another, and as for Alexandra -- in the first few scenes, I had trouble distinguishing the actress from someone in drag.  Janet Suzman was the worst casting flub of all, unless you count the stilted manner in which Michael Jayston delivered his lines.  What a stiff and boring character he makes Nicholas to be.  Yet there are photos extant of Nicholas smiling as he played with his children.  Nicholas was also portrayed as obsessed with holding on to his power as Tsar.  But in the Robert Massie book after which the movie was purportedly modeled, it was very clear that Nicholas was acutely aware of his responsibilities to the Russian people, as well as to his family, and above all his son, the future Tsar.  There was nothing exceptional about his behavior; most of Europe at the time was ruled by kings and queens, and to all of them, the thought of losing their thrones was simply unthinkable.Yet this film falls into the trap most of us do, of judging history not on the basis of its own terms, but with our usual spectacularly accurate 20/20 hindsight.  Having been fed Soviet propaganda for 75 years, we have it entrenched in our minds that Nicholas was an extremely poor ruler.  That's the stunning success of the Massie book, that someone who had absolutely no connection to Russians, and no connection to royalty save for the one coincidence of both their sons having hemophilia, was able to overcome the general (and erroneous) ""knowledge"" of his time and write the kind of sympathetic biography of this family that was long lacking.  The movie, on the other hand, makes Nicholas look petty, and Alexandra slightly over the edge.One petty anachronism was the scene that showed the royal family praying just prior to Nicholas's sending off his troops into World War I.  It was badly researched, to the point of ludicrousness.  The Tsars of Russia were all Orthodox Christians.  Orthodox Christianity has its own very distinctive music; in fact, Russian Orthodox chant is very different from Greek Orthodox chant.  So what kind of background music did the director choose?  Gregorian, of course!  Can we at least *strive* for a little authenticity?!Apparently not.  Massie wrote in considerable detail about the attitude of the Romanovs towards their captors, how their guards had to be changed every three or so months because they kept winning over the Bolsheviks:  ""You aren't anything like what we thought,"" was the most frequently quoted comment on the subject.  The movie showed nothing of that.  Well -- in the end, it was this exact trait of graciousness and consideration towards their captors that ended up getting the Romanov family canonized in the Russian Orthodox Church.  That movement was well underway by 1971; I wonder, if the directors and producers had done a little more thorough research, if the film would have been a tad more sympathetic to these five people caught between two worlds and two cultures.All in all, purchasing the movie was a waste of money.  Maybe the Bolsheviks over at the University's Russian Department will appreciate my donating it -- that way, others can get to see it without wasting their money"	0

"As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who ""ruined"" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can see"	0

 I tried. I really tried, but I was simply incapable of getting into this program. The lead character in Nighty Night is so thoroughly, contemptably self-centered and unlikable she makes Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear. This is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life. She's also insane. Completely. And not in a cute or funny way. She dosen't live in this world. She lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her, making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous, dishonest or rude. She literaly has no idea she's a monster. I can see how that could be funny but not with this show's incredibly dry, lifeless presentation. I never thought I'd say this but Nighty Night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we're supposed to laugh. And I hate laugh tracks.	0
Let me accept the fact that LOTR is my most beloved film and I already own the extended editions of the films in one set! I'm really not surprised to see New Line coming up with another edition of the trilogy. With films like these they will squeeze the collectors as much as they can!! Still, inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped Costa Botes documentaries, my advise to anyone buying LOTR for the first time is- DO NOT BUY THIS SET! Spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6.1 DTS EX glory, alongwith hours of endless in-depth bonus features which probably you'll spend rest of your life watching!!Please be aware, these new editions DO NOT contain DTS tracks, no commentary tracks by the director, Weta workshop or the cast. All you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc...AND NOTHING ELSE. It would have been a better idea had New Line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again....And even this is not the end, once the HD format gains a little more acceptance, they'll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy!Beware, Extended edition set is the ultimate LOTR experience, in terms of films or bonus features. Go get it...Its worth all the money spent!	0

"There aren't many films from any era that come close to being ""perfect"" (though that's not really the right word) in just about every way--probably you could count them on your fingers and have some left over.""Friendly Persuasion"" is one of those films--in spades. Directed by William Wyler and starring Gary Cooper, Dorothy McGuire, and Tony Perkins, it is a wonderful, human story about a loving family of Quakers (also known as Friends) living in one of the Union-Confederate ""border"" states at the time of the Civil War in the 1860s.The cast, in small roles and large, is uniformly excellent, none calling attention to themselves but rather becoming their characters and making us understand them. Led by beloved, legendary star Gary Cooper in a great performance as the head of the Quaker family Jess Birdwell, they are marvelous, including child actor Richard Eyer as feisty ""Little Jess"", scrapping with his big sister or partaking in a running feud with ""Samantha"", his mother Eliza Birdwell's pet goose, who more than carries her end of the feud with scene-stealing craftiness.There are incidents of family humor and love and occasional disagreements, and a hilarious episode in which eldest son Josh  (Perkins) accompanies father Jess on a sales trip and is set upon by the scrappy, amorous daughters of one of Jess's customers (Marjorie Main). We are settled into a lovely, lively exploration of the Birdwell family's idyllic existence.Then the war intrudes.Josh feels he must volunteer to fight as long as others have to, even though it is against the teachings of his faith. His younger sister loves a young Union officer who is soon to go into battle. Rebel troops are nearing the region where they live, and no one, including the audience, quite knows what will happen.There is a beautifully honest and dramatic sequence in which young Josh gets his first taste of battle, which Perkins performs with heartbreaking realism. I recall my father, a World War II veteran, saying that this scene was the most realistic depiction of a young man's first time in battle that he had ever seen in the movies.When it is all over and the Birdwells return to their quiet, hard-working, loving life as a family, the music (Dimitri Tiomkin's marvelous score) swells, the wonderful lyrics to the song ""Friendly Persuasion"" are sung sweetly by the young Pat Boone, and you realize you have spent two wonderful hours with these genuinely fine, completely human characters in ordinary life and in challenging times.The story has been told with integrity, honesty, humanity, gentle humor, kind restraint and, yes, love--all of these also attributes of the Birdwell family that we have come to know. That is the ""genius"" of this film. Along with a very few others, it shows us who we are, who we can be, and how we can live, all with a grace and humility that is almost poetic. And the film never, ever loses its balance.It's just a great and good movie. I've seen it almost a dozen times, and it can still move me to tears. I'm betting it could be released today, amid the ridiculously over-budgeted, badly executed films that rely too much on computer effects and star charisma, and that it would clean up at the box office.The term ""family values"" has been kicked around a lot lately, and nobody quite seems to know what is really meant by it. Watch this truly beautiful film and you'll get a pretty good idea of the genuine meaning of those words."	1
"I remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of HEAVEN'S PRISONERS into a busy Saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release. Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera, our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and Alec Baldwin groupies (a.k.a. my mom, my stepfather, and me) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment. Baldwin, who also served as co-producer, brought James Lee Burke's New Orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke's characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue, they're hampered by two things: 1.) The film's slo-o-o-ow pacing. Maybe the Louisiana heat got to everyone, not just Baldwin. Of all the actors, Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most, so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with Albert Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE! 2.) A plot that, as rendered in the film (whether it's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor, I can't be sure), never quite follows through on any of its elements. It's too bad, because these elements could've made for an exciting movie: drug dealing, illegal alien smuggling, rival crime bosses (one is played colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself, essentially playing a Southern-fried version of his character from director Phil Joanou's 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS), an adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl (named ""Alafair"" by the Robichouxs, after Dave's mom. Late in my pregnancy at the time, I liked the name Alafair so much, I nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter Siobhan!), and a bevy of beautiful, beguiling women, including earth mother Kelly Lynch, vampy Teri Hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time, and Mary Stuart Masterson, looking like a young Jessica Lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her: a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux. Despite the sexy promises in the movie's ads, none of the ladies share anything with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces. Maybe the climate was already so hot, the filmmakers didn't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from heat prostration! As my mom put it at the time: ""I thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy, dashing Alec Baldwin, but he came up sweaty, rumpled, tired, depressed, and moving as if he was in slow motion. If he'd made love as many times as he got beaten up, it would've been the sexiest picture of '96!"" To be fair, there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes, but there's just too darn much talky, molasses-paced lag time between them -- and yet, oddly, some of the scenes end abruptly just as they're about to become intriguing! Perhaps Joanou, Baldwin & Co. could've dredged a tighter, more involving thriller out of this if they'd whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so. As HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is now...well, read James Lee Burke's books instead."	0

"I liked this movie when i first saw it and i seen it about 10 times... i like to watch any movie that involves gangs (especially bloods & crips) so i can learn from them...If you're looking or are just a collector like me of gang movies... you may not want this one in your collection... becuase to me, it doesn't show enough Bloods & Crips in it.... the characters are fictional....there are some minor gangs in it as well called The White Fences (Latino/Hispanic gang - i've never heard of this gang, so i don't know if they are true or not.).The actors who play the gang members of the White Fences are good actors though... i think they are better then Don Cheadle and Wayans who play Crip members... this movie centers more on White Fence and their rivalry w/ Crips... there's not too much focus on Bloods in here... it also more focuses on Sean Penn's character and Robert Duvall too (good cop/bad cop), and Penn on how he falls in love w/ a former gangmember woman in the White Fence gang.Colors is a good watch...i just wish it had more gang focus in it...and more gang sets (chapters, i.e. Eight Tray Gangsters, Hoover, etc...) If you're looking for a good gang buy, buy the book ""Monster"" by Sanyika Shakur a.k.a. Monster Kody Scott, or ""Do Or Die"" by Leon Bing. Those 2 books far surpasses this movie.."	1

In Alan Alda's &quot;Betsy's Wedding&quot;,he is Eddie Hopper,a construction foreman and architect. His daughter Betsy(Molly Ringwald) and her boyfriend Jake Lovell(Dylan Walsh) announce their engagement at a family gathering. Betsy's sister Connie(Ally Sheedy) is happy herself but jealously upset because she can't find herself a man. The late Madeline Kahn is Lola,Eddie's wife. At the gathering Lola's sister Gloria Henner(Catherine O'Hara) tells her she plans to get even with her husband Oscar(Oscar winner Joe Pesci) for all his inept schemes. Gloria says &quot;Someday,when I have my nice little nestegg,I can take a walk and he can go f--- himself.&quot; Anthony LaPaglia is Stevie Dee,a guy who would later in the film become Connie's boyfriend. Stevie Dee's uncle Georgie(Burt Young) is a business associate of Oscar's. There's once scene where when Betsy and Jake meet with the man performing their wedding ceremony,the Dixie Cups' CHAPEL OF LOVE is played. They want to be pronounced &quot;husband and wife&quot; instead of &quot;man and wife&quot; and they have &quot;obey&quot; omitted from &quot;love,honor and obey&quot;. The late Julie Bovasso plays Rose,Eddie's mother and Joey Bishop is Eddie's deceased father. The father,as a ghost,is seen and heard only by Eddie. The wedding was somewhat disasterous. It took place in a rented tent on a rainy evening. The tent was made of cheap,not-too-strong materials so a hole in the roof where the rain fell into increased to the point where it caved in. After a heated argument between Gloria and Oscar at the reception also in the tent,Gloria pulls a loose thread causing the growing hole and the dowse of fallen rain. So Connie and Stevie Dee can be together more often,Stevie Dee applies to the police academy,since Connie's a cop. Unbelievably,the wedding dinner was pizza! By the way,Oscar planned to divorce Gloria and become romantically involved with his secretary,who also attended Betsy's and Jake's wedding. That was one of the things that led to the argument. The wedding ceremony was performed in the Jewish style. Jake stepped on a wine glass wrapped in a cloth napkin. This film was Alan Alda's most successful and not a minor hit like &quot;A New Life&quot;,another one of his personally scripted films	1
"For Ina Claire NINOTCHKA was a last chance to show posterity what she could do, for there wouldn't be many film opportunities offered her.  She'd been a leading lady of the stage for nigh on thirty years, and her elegant beauty, very much a high-bred Dina Merrill type look, was still aglow. She was one of Carl Van Vechten's favorite subjects and he took photo after photo of her, staring imperiously against a wall of baize, or reclining on a lace pillow as fleecy as her beautiful blonde hair.She suffered the ultimate indignity the following year at MGM, when her part in I TAKE THIS WOMAN was taken away from her and given to the cheaper Verree Teasdale.  Her director, Josef Von Sternberg was also let go, and in fact the whole picture was redone so many times studio wags called it I RE-TAKE THIS WOMAN!  The ""woman"" in question was Hedy Lamarr; after Ina Claire's hilarious showdowns with Garbo in NINOTCHKA, the studio might have thought her perfect for the part of Lamarr's Central European rival.  A year or so later, and Edmund Goulding put her to work as Dorothy McGuire's mother in the charming, underrated CLAUDIA, but that is definitely a mother part and as such, put an end to Ina Claire's film career.As the countess ""Swana"" she gets lots of Billy Wilder's best lines and laughs.  She's not afraid of anyone, much less Garbo.  Much has been written about the chemistry between Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, indeed a delightful mix, but the picture would have lacked a lot of its edge without Swana's steely, icy hauteur and her adroit manipulations.In real life Ina Claire lived on to a great old age.  She was 92 when the last curtain fell for her, and here in San Francisco, where she spent most of her life, all the lights in her building went off for an hour, precisely at 8:30, while her fans stood on the street, devoted and vigilant in our own way as the fans surrounding the Dakota Hotel when John Lennon died"	1
    This is my first review for Amazon. I've always felt that the reviews that I read were adequate to represent the movies and anime that I liked. Not this time.    I have an extensive collection of anime. Everything from the really silly stuff, filled with fan service, to the very serious classics that so many fans rave about. I'm not really into the mecha thing, though I do have a lot of it. It's the animation first that drives my interest, then its the story and the character development are close seconds.     Appleseed has all that I'm looking for in an anime, and in Spades. Great characters, a well crafted plot, and some of the best animation I have ever see. To say, as some reviewers have, that the movement in this version are unnatural,is more than unfair, it's just not true. All action is extremely lifelike, and the action scenes are the best I've ever seen. I actually found myself reversing the disc to rewatch some action repeatedly, something I never do.    I've owned this version of Appleseed a few weeks now, and I have watched it at least five times, and am looking forward to another veiwing soon.    I have relied on Amazon  reveiws to decide whether or not to buy anime in the past, so I hope that this reveiw is helpful. There is a lot of good anime worth investing in, and this one is near the top of my list	1
Like her legendary mother, nobody around today takes command of the stage like Liza Minnelli and this legendary event at New York's Radio City Music Hall clearly illustrates this...always a five star event in concert, I have been fortunate to experience this thrilling and amazing performer numerous times in concert from 1970 to 2005 and I am here to say that she has still got it and always will!!! In recent years for some silly reason that I don't get, the media has tried to damage Liza's artistic credibility but it doesn't work when Liza takes to the stage and shows sold out audiences with her soulful singing and great performing skills what she is all about and that she is and always will be a true legendary Superstar...numerous standing ovations later it is clear that Liza is going to be around for a long time to come and this tremendous concert is a keeper...BRAVO Liza and keep on rocking!!	1
"There are certainly some memorable scenes in this film, but as a whole it just didn't quite work for me.  Vlastimil Brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character: Fanda, a maddening yet adorable grandpa, oh-so-young-at-heart, oh-so-mischievious and impish, but somehow oh-so-good-hearted and harmless that you can't help loving him warts and all.In fact, that's one of the fatal flaws of this movie: the lack of any dark side to any of the characters.  They're all basically harmless Walt Disney types, even the bumbling and self-absorbed son.  There are no real consequences to Brodsky's actions other than Stella (his wife) finally talking divorce but it's obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she'll come back to him.  There is no center, no force or dynamic power in this film---it's like a limp wine that you tolerate because you don't want to hurt the feelings of your host.  The ending also relies on another lazy device, the virtual deux ex machina in the person of Stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice/supporter of Fanda's when she sees that his attempt at self-reform is only making him miserable.This film might've been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with Fanda's desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death, instead of focusing on how clever, audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is, which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse, narcissism.  One wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with Mr. Brodsky, who is a towering figure among Czech actors, that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him.  A more accurate title for this movie, especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll, might be: ""The Fantasy Life of a Poor Old Man."" "	0
"The population of Hong Kong is approximately 7 million people. I'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie. Usually when a movie runs over 2 hours, it's because there's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in. In the case of Hard Boiled, the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by John Woo's desire to get into the Guinness Book of Records for ""most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture.""Chow Yun-Fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay, and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff. He shoots (usually with a pistol in each hand) while diving headlong over furniture, while swinging from a rope, while sliding down a banister(!), while being hurled through the air by explosions. Sometimes he even shoots while standing still. And he shoots, and shoots, and shoots. And the bad guys shoot, and shoot, and shoot. And Yun-Fat's fellow cops shoot, and shoot, and -- you get the idea.There are some fine action scenes in this film, but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended. There wasn't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned from the next, and it became painfully repetitious. Personally I would highly recommend The Replacement Killers over Hard Boiled. There's plenty of Yun-Fat's balletic shoot-em-up action, but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire"	0
One of those cases where everything goes wrong in the making of a movie: low budget, unispired performances (Alexis Denisof is particularly bad here), lack of decent screenplay for the actors to work upon, bad direction, despisable characters, cliched situations... How Kinski chose to act in this one?	0
"This film is one big joke:  you have all the basics elements of romance (love at first sight, great passion, etc.) and gangster flicks (brutality, dagerous machinations, the mysterious don, etc.), but it is all done with the crudest humor.It's the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately ""get"" or you don't.  That is a matter of taste and expectations.  I enjoyed it and it took me back to the mid80s, when Nicolson and Turner were in their primes.  The acting is very good, if a bit obviously tongue-in-cheek.Recommended"	1
First off, let me say that I know next to nothing about art.  I would like to cultivate an appreciation for great artwork, but it certainly does not come naturally - especially when it comes to modern art.  Dali, however, is a master I at least have some affinity with.  Who doesn't know of the melting clocks?  I have also seen the dream sequence he created for Hitchcock's film Spellbound in 1945.  Plus, the guy was just plain weird, and that is something I know a little bit about myself.This Artists of the 20th Century DVD looks solely at Dali's artwork.  All you see throughout the 50 minutes of video is one piece after another.  There is no biographical look at the man, no mention of his contributions to the world beyond his paintings, and certainly no commentary on his eccentric personality (or mustache).  There is not even an adequate identification of Gala, his inspiration and muse, despite numerous references to her in his paintings.  Thus, this DVD will not introduce you to Dali the man or Dali the artist - it only looks at selected pieces of the art work of the maestro.Dali's artwork is obviously impressive, and I was surprised by the variety of his work and styles.  The narrator offers insight into some paintings - others, you just look and advance.  I don't understand a lot of Dali's work, nor can I see some of the things the narrator tells me are in his more abstract pieces.  The melting clocks and other surrealist images appeal to me.  Dark works such as Visage of War speak volumes to the human observer, and the disappearing bust of Voltaire paintings are also striking.   I was most impressed by the small sample of classical pieces Dali painted, however - largely because I did not know he ever produced such works.  My idea of a painting equates with something like Design for the Interior Decoration of a Stable-Library, which is a strikingly beautiful work.Is this DVD worth watching?  I will have to say No.  If you're a know-nothing novice like me, there is not enough basic information provided to really illuminate the artwork you will be shown.  If you're knowledgeable about Dali, you'll be disappointed by the limited nature of the production and by the exquisite Dali works excluded from the show.  After watching this, I decided to peruse some Dali galleries online, and I must say that the Internet makes this DVD of little value.  Not only are the analyses and critical comments you will find online far superior to the information provided in this video, the quality of the paintings themselves are far better online than they are on the DVD	0

"I watched parts of all the ""Let's Dance Salsa"" DVDs and what a joke.  Is this guy serious?  He needs to get a few DVDs himself to find out about Salsa, rhythm, lead and following, and just general concepts of dancing.  I agree with a few other folks who wrote reviews...what qualifies him as an instructor?  I think he's doing an injustice to Salsa.  If anyone is considering learning from these DVDs...don't.  You'll not only learn some bad habits in dancing, but you'll be a joke on the dance floor.The only worth these DVDs have to anyone interested in Salsa is for a good laugh.  Seriously...Amazon should consider removing this product"	0
I really enjoyed this film, basically the Coen Bros. homage to the film noir genre. (I always thought the name was funny, since it's French, and yet most of famous directors were German, like Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, etc. :-)). The sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool, unhurried, nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey. Thornton is great in the lead as the reticent, phlegmatic barber, and if anything, he is even more convincing with hair than without--even his hairpiece is 50s-ish. :-) The whole cast does a fine job in their roles, and both Gandolfini and Shaloub  have a couple of show-stealing scenes. I found the film's climax a complete surprise, as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber, for whom everything seems to be working out up till then. Overall a great film and probably one of the Coen Bros. best. If you're a Coen Bros. fan you won't find this one a disappointment.	1
My husband received this DVD for his birthday. My husband grew up with the Pittsburg Steelers and still today is a true fan.

Yup, definately the worst Halloween movie. Come on, Michael on a reality show? Ha! What the f**k does that have to do with the series? Not only that, but the plot is completely pointless, the acting sucks, and Dr. Loomis and Jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie! Not only that, but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary, and therefore comes off as pretentious. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE gore in movies, horror or not, but any knowledgable Halloween fan knows that the Halloween movies were always scary without the gore. Along with Halloween 3 (which actually had nothing to do with Michael), Halloween: Resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series. There are a many more problems with the movie than the ones I listed, but I'm tired of typing, so I'll let other reviewers explain why it's so bad. Bottom line, watch ANY Halloween movie other than this or Halloween 3	0
"While ""Scary Movie 4"" does work in getting out a couple of laughs, it certainly does not live up to the past three.  Many of the jokes that were used are redundant and frankly, are getting pretty old.  Although this movie had a lot of different material to work with such as The Grudge, Saw, and War of the Worlds, it misses the funny mark just by a bit.  Personally, I felt they could have done a LOT more in terms of parodying these films, particularily with The Grudge.  The writers should have taken more advantage of the content they had to spoof in order to have made this film a lot more funnier.  And really, was it necessary to spoof films such as Brokeback Mountain and Millionaire Dollar Baby, both of which are not horror films?I believe the comedy in this film is aimed towards a more mature audience, and is vastly different from what Scary Movies 1 & 2 offered (which I found to be extremely hilarious).  If you're looking for over the top funny, look towards the other Scary Movies"	0
I am big horror movie fan so this flick sat with me fairly well.It was kind of cornie but with Yvonne(lily munster)DeCarlo and a great actor in Rod Steiger it held my interest,also throw in Michael J Pollard who always plays an off the wall character and I guess that is what keeps this movie afloat	0
"I actually saw this movie when it first came out, and was so blown away by Robert Downey Jr's performance (he was just starting out on his illustrious, if self-destructive career) that I didn't notice much else about the movie, certainly not Jami Gertz or Andrew McCarthy who are as close to being ciphers as it's possible to have on the big screen.   (The adults in the film are as cipheresque as the kids, so there is no real dramatic interest there -- we have only the kids, and their interactions with drugs, the party scene, and each other.)Seeing it again 25 years later, well ...Downey's performance still holds up, but the rest of the movie is less than zero (sorry).  The director is so absorbed with staging endless party scenes (unintentionally hilarious in their excesses) that he forgets to give the main characters anything interesting to do, and they never develop into anyone we care about.  The final scene, with McCarthy and Gertz sitting forlornly in a cemetery, has no emotional payoff whatever-- McCarthy says come with me to the East Coast, Gertz responds yes, I'll go with you, and the viewer says, ""Thank God, that means the movie's over."" Finally, James Spader doesn't play a real character either, but as other reviewers have noted, he is interestingly slimy as the chief bad guy.  Glad to see he's still getting work, in a fairly interesting role on ""Boston Legal"". "	0

"Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception.  Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either.Rita is the fading star.  It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any ""doll"", ""dame"" or ""mouse?"", would fall for either of these gals.Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog.  He stole every scene he was in.  Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie"	0
Season 3 of The L-Word is by far the best yet.The character development and story have come so far since the 1st season, and are even better than season 2.They have scaled back the sex a little bit, but when they do put it in, the sparks really fly.I love the l-word	1
"This is not a good film.  I wanted to like it because I love South Park and I think that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are comedic geniuses.

"**1/2When it was released in 1967, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" was acclaimed as a ""breakthrough"" film for its lighthearted, yet serious, depiction of an interracial romance.  In the years since, society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of so-called ""mixed marriages"" that any remake is bound to feel, at least to some extent, superfluous and anachronistic.  And that is exactly the case with ""Guess Who,"" a 2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many changes the filmmakers have rung on the Stanley Kramer original.The screenwriters' first alteration involves switching the race roles, so that it is now a black family having to accept a white male as a prospective in-law rather than the other way around.  Bernie Mac assumes the Spencer Tracy role as the father whose world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a Caucasian boyfriend (Ashton Kutcher as a white Sidney Poitier) home to meet the family.  On the distaff side, we have Judith Scott taking over for Katherine Hepburn as the understanding mother and Zoe Saldana replacing Katherine Houghton as the freethinking daughter.Since interracial marriage is no longer the hot-button issue it once was, the filmmakers have been forced to inject a number of other non-race-related plot complications into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama.  Thus, we have Kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his fiance and her family that he has recently quit his high-paying job at a prestigious firm and that he may, in fact, be the target of a securities-and-exchange commission probe.  Indeed, with Kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical and overbearing future father-in-law, ""Guess Who"" feels more like a remake of ""Meet the Parents"" than of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.""The real problem with ""Guess Who"" is that it rarely has the courage of its convictions.  Having decided to tackle a relatively dicey topic, the film too often drops the issue in favor of scenes that wouldn't pass muster even on a third-rate sitcom.  For every scene that is incisive and daring - i.e. Kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner table - there is another that is pure Hollywood hokum (Mac and Kutcher sleeping in the same bed together, Mac and Kutcher having a go-cart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level and the greater machismo, etc.).  All of the performers are fine, especially Mac and Kutcher in the lead roles.  However, they just haven`t been given very sophisticated material to work with here.  ""Guess Who"" might have been a better film had it aimed more for genuine, hard-edged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and predictable romantic comedy sentimentality.  Still, it's been 38 years since ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" first shocked the nation with its in-your-face defiance of miscegenation laws, and the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice and marital definition.  Which is why, in the year 2005, ""Brokeback Mountain"" was a breakthrough film and ""Guess Who"" was not"	0
Alec Baldwin is tied with John Goodman for the second highest appearing host of all time.  So it's only natural that he now has a best of DVD.  This is not the best SNL DVD, but it is still a VERY good one.  If you already have the best of Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Steve Martin, and Tom Hanks... get this one next.  This DVD has a couple of not-so-good skits, but it makes up for every one.  There are a lot of hilarious skits on the DVD.  I'm not going to list them, but just trust me.  Anyone who gives this less than four stars is OUT OF THEIR MIND.  When I first saw that the Best of Alec Baldwin was out I didn;t have to give it a second thought.  It was at the top of my list, and it should be at the top of yours too. 	1
"Every Lakers fan I've ever met lives in the past sadly now.  To them, the clock stopped when Kareem and Magic hung up the shoes [and we know why Magic had to leave].  Their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding.  After this, however, they don't have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization.The Lakers have been a good team over the decades [as apparent on this DVD set], but the run of greatness is coming to a LONG slide with Kobe driving the Bus.  The Lakers were once considered the Green Bay Packers of the NFL, but now they're just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the Western Conference which are much better than the present Lakers.I recently attended a game last Fall at the Staples Center, and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands, I could barely hear myself think over Phil Jackson's mantra ""I told you so.""Further illustrating how things have changed in LA, Jack Nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow.So it is understandable that Laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of Magic and Kareem, than rather extol the diminishing skills of Kobe since his Colorado folly.  There are some good games on this DVD along with great moments from the Baylor, Chamberlain, West days.  I recommend any Laker fan to purchase this DVD set to relive the past.So Laker fans, keep living in the past if you so desire.  Maybe Kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the Lakers to the NBA Championship promised land once again.Long live the Forum [or the Staple Remover Center] or whatever they are calling the Lakers home now"	0
Edmund O'Brien is a CPA who decides to get away to San Francisco for a weekend to sow some wild oats (and also to get away from his secretary who's nagging him to marry her). There he's poisoned and told he has only a few days to live; he tries to find out who poisoned him and why. The trail takes him into a world of corruption and double dealing. Following this trail is a bit confusing for O'Brien and the audience. But the picture is tightly directed and well acted. A highly regarded film-noir entry, and rightly so. Worth a watch	1
DO NOT BUY!!! Great movie bad studio!! It has been announced that NEW LINE is replacing Peter Jackson as the director of The Hobbit. The only way to stop this injustice is to hit them were it hurts the wallet. Do not buy or see anything New Line till The Hobbit is returned to its rightful director!!!	0
"We started with ""There Goes a Dump Truck"" which actually features a different ""Dave.""  This first Dave was in the Dumptruck, Tractor and Farm Truck versions - maybe a few others - and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly he is. The newer Dave (Dave Hood) is in all the rest (along with his sidekick, Becky, in some) and is much less goofy than the other Dave.  I don't think the kids really care though...the sillier the better and my son loves them both. Anyway, I started with the dumptruck one when my son was almost 2 and he was immediately glued to the TV.  I don't let him watch cartoons and try to limit overall TV to things that are at least somewhat informative/educational.  As a result, he was never one to sit and watch much TV (made it hard for me to get things done!).  But, with this series, he enjoyed watching the real live machines and vehicles (and some of the more goofy moments) so much.   It really was a lifesaver at times.  Needless to say it didn't take long for me to collect the entire series.  I have watched them along with him and learned quite a bit about different occupations.  My in-laws were farmers and really enjoyed watching the ""Tractor"" and ""Farm Truck"" versions with him. His favorites include ""There goes a Firetruck,"" ""There goes a Monster Truck"" and ""There goes a Spaceship.""  But, he literally rotates through all of them and has over the past year plus!  I can't say enough good things about the video series as far as my son's enjoyment goes.  Just don't look for any oscars for the acting and editing.  It's pretty choppy, even for an amateur eye. I would highly recommend any in this series if your child likes any type of machine or vehicle. "	1
"Actually I felt I was in love with this film as soon as I saw the very beginning - the opening credits against the background of Chicago seen from high above and provided with beautiful music. ""Candyman"" could have become another teenage urban legend flick with not much of a sense, but Bernard Rose managed to squeeze everything possible from the story making a brilliant, enchanting and spellbinding film out of it. If you're interested mostly in gore and some physical manifestations of horror you won't find it here (you will, but not in quantities you used to). ""Candyman"" is more of a psychological horror where atmosphere is what's important, where mood is what matters, where you are given some food for thought. I don't have enough words to describe the whole perfection of this gorgeous film, I can only say it's a great achievement of Bernard Rose as a director besides I guess Tony Todd, Virginia Madsen and Xander Berkeley had their best roles played in this feature. I don't personally think that 90s were fertile regarding the horror genre, but ""Candyman"" is a true gem which wouldn't be lost among the greatest horror titles of all times. By the way if you don't want to spoil your impression of the film, better don't watch ""Candyman"" parts 2 and 3. They ARE the average tenage urban legend flicks.  "	1
I've been wanting to see this movie and I finally did on LOGO. I'm just happy I waited untill It came on TV. I though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it. The romance was slim to none. I thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role. Well, I won't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it. Anyway, I would much rather watch Beautiful Thing, Get Real, All Over the Guy & The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In love	0
Standard disclaimer: I LOVE Dream Theater.However, this DVD is almost unbearable to watch due to all of the video effects that obscure the live performance. Didn't I buy a DVD of Dream Theater live so that I could see them play?? At times, several minutes pass without showing the musicians as they're playing.Video effects such as swirling colors, images of the artists upside down (?!?), and black and white re-enactments make the whole affair feel like someone was trying to create their first music video for MTV in 1984. Or maybe trying to induce an epileptic seizure in the viewer??Dream Theater would get a rating of 1000, but I'd give this DVD a 0 if I could. Just goes to show what poor editing gets you	0
I only bought this one for the song by Jerry Orbach.  The first 2 DVDs were better	0
"I really tried to come to this movie with and open mind. I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen and I thought the 1995 BBC miniseries actually came close to doing justice to her novel. Still, I was looking foreward to seeing a new interpretation. Unfortunately this one seemed to miss the point of the story. Jane Austen had a hilarious way of satarizing the social conventions and mores while being in their midst. This film ignores the social conventions altogether and therefore misses a great deal of Austen's humor. For example an unmarried man and woman would NEVER greet each other in their pajamas. A man would never visit his fiancee while she was lying sick in bed in her nightgown. When these rules of propriety are ignored by the film, how are we supposed to understand or believe that it's a big deal when Lydia runs away with Wickham!? Another example is Lady Catherine. This is a woman who lives and dies by her snobbery and rigorous adherance to social conventions. Yet in this film we see her barge into the Bennet household in the middle of the night and wake Lizzie up to ask a question that could easily waited until morning (when Lady Catherine wouldn't have had to get her carriage driver out of bed to drive several miles in the dark- no streetlights remember- to the Bennet household) Because no one adhere's to societies rigorous, and for the most part arbitrary, rules, the movie misses the opportunies to subtly wink at the audience as it laughs at such things.Another weakness lies in the casting. Granted these actors had big shoes to fill. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle seemed to embody their characters in the 1995 miniseries, but as I said, there are other ways to interpret and play the characters. Unforunately here everyone seems as if they're reading lines with dramatic inflection- not acting. You can almost imagine Keira Knightly's script having notes saying ""insert spunkiness here"".  While the scenery is lovely, the windswept cliff and farm images seem to recollect the tortured landscape of a Bronte adaptation more than a manacured Austen setting. Overall this film comes off as one big missed opportunity"	0
This movie is pure fun.  My whole family loved it.  It's corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it's amatuer hour, but its fun to watch.  We made popcorn and laughed our way through the whole thing.  Watch it and enjoy	1
I bought basically, because I love Denisee Richards and Daryl Hanna, plus I like also Valerie Tasso, besides I am a fan of Pierre Woodman, they all appear on the film, among some well know adult stars like Dora Venter, Rita Faltoyano. But really the film is not good at all, it is slow, the elements don't match. It is sometimes hard to follow. It is really not worth buying it	0
"I saw this movie about two weeks ago and I can't believe how disappointed I am for this. I was expecting fireworks; instead I got a truckload of bad karma on my head. Not only that but it maybe the most over-the-top film I ever saw and it will be on my list of the worst movies I ever saw. To begin with half of the characters die in this film and I was like 'What is the meaning?' then there's the film's signature moment in which Sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such a matter that they put his face right at the camera. Again I said to myself, 'What's the point?' And then there's the chilling climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the Kennedy assassination-from the scoped rifle right down to James Gregory's character getting shot in the head. In one of the documentries to this DVD director William Fredkin says that there is no doubt this movie caused Lee Harvey Oswald to kill President Kennedy because 'Oswald realized that he was Raymond Shaw.' If he's right that raises the question: Did he do it by his beliefs or did someone push him over? Then Fredkin ends his obseravation by saying that the release of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and the death of President Kennedy are the two events that made the 1960's what it is and why people today (including me) are still obessed with that decade. In conclusion, I think this was a big disappoinment. And this movie is on the list of AFI's 100 greatest films? Please."	0
For those reviewers who have not seen the remakes, see DAIL M FOR MURDER by Alfred Hitchcock, PERFECT MURDER starring Michael Douglas and Gyneth Paltrow, not to mention countless TV movies of the week.This is the original and the best.Barbara Stanwyck is superb, as is Burt Lancaster. Moody and dark and suspenseful.	1
When the lead character acts like she's sleepwalking through the entire film, that's distracting! When just about anyone from my high school's drama class could do a much better job while brushing their teeth, then it's time to open up the wallet, and hire better talent.Once you get past the special affects, all which use cheesy models, this godforsaken movie is boring as sin, or, should I say mud! Beside being preposterous, for example, the meteroid, or whatever, ONLY hits a dam in its first strike, this pitiful film is also delusional! Remember the scene where the head of FEMA risks his life to save someone who is obviously in danger of being wiped out by fire. As Hurricane Katrinia proves, there is no such thing as a bureaucratic, administrator hero! Instead, this movie comes off as a piece of not-so-subtle Federal government propaganda not worthy of a moment of your time	0
I loved this  DVd set! Grew up watching it..and remember running home after school to catch each days episodes. Watching this  set transported me back to another time, when things were peaceful and less frazzeled! Stayed up till 2 am watching it all and felt like that little kid from school again! Like many young girls back then I was 'in love' with Tim Considine! So nice to see he and David back talking about it! I hope Disney Co. will put out the next 2 series of this great show on DVD soon	1
Someone wanted to make Indiana Jones part 4, starring Tom Hanks and created a such puzzled labyrinth that I think the book author wouldn't be able to tell the whole story without looking into his notes. After watching this movie it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that you have vaisted 2 hours on nonsense.  5 Stars for special effects	0
"Leeches is a terrible movie.  Dude, I have never seen anything so gay in my whole life (except the director's other film Speed Demon).  When the guys were less clothes than the gals, thats not a good sign.  The video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director's work.They're all filled with loads of homoeroticism.  Women are ugly and they were single piece bathing suits whilst the guys wear banana hammocks.  The 'roided up leeches enter their ""male"" victims through anal orrifices.  After watching about a half hour of this mess I had to turn it off.Why does this guy fool people into renting these movies.  I don't mind gay subtext in films but when it takes over the film and hits you over the head with it then it's time to draw the line.  No hetro relationships in this one.  Just the director molesting his male stars with his camera.Horrible stuff, stay away from David DeCoteau's work and his fifty different aliases (unless you know what you're in for)"	0
this was a great movie i really enjoyed it . the story was unique and the acting was great .i thought it was the best ghost story i have seen 	1
This movie is soooooo boring!!!! The only thing good about this movie is the superfly soundtrack laced by none other than Curtis Mayfield!!! Avoid this movie. It sucks	0
After many years of sleeping in his coffin, the vampire Lestat awakens only to find that the world has changed and he wants to be a part of it. He gathers a following and becomes a rock star only to find that his music awakens the ancient Queen Akasha and she wants him to become her king. Worth at least a rental!	1
I resent the comment of the reviewer who said this is the worst film in 100 years.  I make it 200.  The other reviewers have noted the idiotic factual mistakes that makes this such a howler.  I just loved the U.S Air Force personnel with Scottish and English accents.  They must have overrun the $500 budget at that point. 	0
Again, another interesting pop-corn director that makes a couple of good low budget films and when Hollywood gives to him a free hand (or not so much) things go wrong.  Is not funny, Wilson and Stiller aren't interesting enough and the 70's isn't a good decade to crave for.  With this kind of films, is useful to listen to American critics, they know more about their own culture than us	0
"   If you are looking for something shocking, don't bother with this movie.     rape scene:  why doesn't she run???? why doesn't she fight??? how come there's all this blood on her all of a sudden??? where did that come from???? stupid.                                                            revenge scenes:  first of all, i wasn't upset enough to thirst for revenge.  second of all, the murder scenes were even weaker than the rape scene.     what you've basically got here is a movie hollywood could remake, scene for scene, including every gratuitous moment. and it would get made.  it would show in theaters.  and lots of annoying people would think it was horrifying.  go rent ""irreversible"" it's much better at this sort of thing.

"For better or worse, after the relative box-office slump of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, producers Brocolli and Saltzman decided to woo Sean Connery back to do one more film for an amazing sum.  Connery, who had said he would never do another Bond film, donated all of his money to his own foundation.  While his performance is competent and smooth as ever, he seems all business.  No longer in love with the character and having realized long before that the character was stagnant, Connery mechanically works his way through DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, an outright bore of the Bond series and, in my opinion, one of the worst (certainly Connery's worst).  While some have tried to save the film by arguing that it is a parody of the Bond genre, it plainly isn't.  It was an attempt to return Bond to his former glory days and generate profit for the producers.  Far from trying to lampoon the Bond formula, the producers were trying to resuscitate it.  And they failed.  After the opening ""gun barrel"" sequence, we quickly find Bond on a personal mission to kill Blofeld once and for all after the death of Bond's only true wife (discounting the false marriage in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.  (At least, this is what we must assume, since no mention of the marriage is made in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER).  Bond catches Blofeld in the process of producing clones for himself in an underground laboratory and, after a couple of struggles with both Blofeld and a duplicate, Bond drowns Blofeld in a vat of mud.  It is a very short and quick opening teaser and immediately runs into the titles sequence.  The titles involves various diamonds, slowly revealed to be various pieces jewelry worn by beautiful women, all set to the title song sung by Shirley Bassey (who also sang the GOLDFINGER title).  The plot of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is quite strange.  In an opening similar to GOLDFINGER, we learn that large quantities of South African diamonds have been smuggled recently and yet, surprisingly, have not made their way to the market.  Worried that the diamonds will be released in order to inflate the diamond market, Bond is sent in to infiltrate the smuggling operation, disguised as Peter Franks.  Bond quickly succeeds, meeting up with Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), an attractive diamond smuggler who is suspicious of Bond's identity.  Bond's mission is almost compromised from the start when the real Peter Franks makes an entrance, forcing Bond to fight him in a terrific elevator sequence that is reminiscent of the train fight in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.  After a smuggling attempt goes awry (thanks to Bond), Bond is discovered and learns of the real purpose of the operation he is infiltrating.  It turns out that Blofeld is behind it all (Bond killed only two duplicates in the opening teaser)!  Blofeld has been smuggling diamonds to create a laser satellite that is capable of destroying anything on Earth.  Blofeld has been hiding his operation by posing as recluse Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean), whom he has secretly kidnapped unbeknownst to the world, and using Whyte's resources and industrial facilities to manufacture his powerful laser.  Blofeld plans to destroy various nuclear installations in America, Russia, and China.  The purpose?  Blofeld is organizing an international auction, offering nuclear supremacy to the highest bidder!  Will Bond be able to stop him in time?  DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER feels like a film that was stitched together, rather poorly, from a myriad of interesting elements.  One feels that the producers had a bunch of ideas on the cutting floor and attempted to piece them together into a logical story order.  The infiltration of a smuggling ring, the wonderful fight sequence in the elevator, the quirky and gay hitmen Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith), a not-so-subtle rendition of the famous Las Vegas recluse Howard Hughes, a fight on an oil rig, et cetera.  All of these elements are fairly interesting in their own right, but the combination doesn't yield what the producers were hoping for.  What is it about this film that feels so ridiculous?  One of the major problems, in my opinion, is situating Bond in Las Vegas.  Bond in America is dull.  His class, wit, and sophistication are only cheapened when placed in the cheesy context of Las Vegas in the 1970s.  Bond is supposed to take us to exotic locations--not to a strip club.  Furthermore, the action is not quite on par with the rest of the series.  I think everyone will agree that the chase scene in which Bond escapes through the desert on a moon buggy is absurd.  The chase is boring, the buggy looks ridiculous and prop-esque, and there is no suspense.  The climactic fight on the oil rig is equally boring.  Sure, we have a big set and big explosions.  But there is no cutting edge stuff here. Connery, as mentioned, looks very tired here.  Tiffany Case is a bit refreshing, but quickly becomes dim-witted and dull.  And the Bond girl with the clever name, Plenty O'Toole (Lana Wood) is only in the film for all of five minutes.  Blofeld is now played by Charles Gray, who first made his appearance as Bond's Japan contact in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.  Gray's performance takes Blofeld back to the ridiculousness of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, even appearing in drag at one point.   There isn't much more to say.  The acting is dead in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.  Now, some have tried to defend DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER by claiming that the film is an outright attempt to make a parody of the Bond genre.  After producing six Bond films, the producers were ready to lampoon their own creation and move Bond into the Roger Moore pun-fest the series would eventually become.  While this certainly seems to create an outlet for the film, it seems plainly false.  If you watch the ""Making of"" documentary on the Ultimate Edition, it is clear that everyone thought they were making a real Bond flick and not a parody.  The producers were trying to bring the series back to its former glory days and to produce big box-office success.  They were not trying to create a subtle piece that exposed the hilarious features of the Bond formula.  Anyone claiming otherwise is just engaging in wishful thinking and rationalization.  This film stinks.  Let's get over it.  Ultimately, I think you should skip DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.  The only reason to see it is if you are a completist about the series and desire to watch them in order.  It is an awkward insert into the series during the transition between Sean Connery and Roger Moore.  The Ultimate Edition does have crisp picture and sound.  If you must struggle through the film, make sure to get this edition because it is at least watchable.  But if you only desire to watch the better Bond films, skip it.  Diamonds may be forever, but this film died a long time ago.  "	0
I worried that the 80s soundtrack would detract from the film's power as a period piece, but it totally didn't.  It was seamless.I will buy this for my home collection.  I have always loved Kirsten Dundst's work and this is no exception	1
"Hey, angry young man! If you're going to just sit there all smug, Mr. ""Yeah, I used to have a TV, but I busted it cuz I just don't care, doggie,"" and make fun of this nation's fine Secret Service, why don't you just go to an axis of evil nation and see how funny it is then? When you're sucking on rocks to stave off the inevitable side effects of dehydration. When, if you want to go to the market to buy more rocks to suck on, you have to whip yourself with metal shards tied to the end of long leather straps as you walk. And just because you saved the sorry excuse for a young lady who will become a drug addict bag lady once she gets old enough to lose hope of realizing her dreams earns you no points in my book. Freedom doesn't come for free, so quit whining about the draft, Dick Trickle! The ""Moonlighting"" tie-in is cute, but quickly turns sour, as Bruce Willis seems to have been off working on another ""Die Hard"" installment while the episode was being filmed and it's just not the same without those sarcastic wing-dingers. Bet you didn't know Lou Ferrigno was Scorsese's first choice for the lead, but he wasn't willing to thin down for the role and he kept firing his language coaches"	0
This movie is so dumb that it's as good with the sound off as with the sound on.  The only reason to watch it is to observe the extreme beauty of both leads.   A plot as old as the written word could still form the basis of an OK movie with a good script, but this script has no charm, no wit, no nothing	0
For a plot synopsis please read the Amazon review. I wish to talk about the reasons why you will love this film.As a longtime fan of both Sam Raimi (of the Evil Dead series) and Bill Paxton (Aliens, Twister), I went to see this on opening night. Not many people can claim this I'm sure because it was and is, such a small film that received next to no marketing. For shame.This film is in the best tradition of modern film noir including BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, both made by the Cohen brothers. Film buffs will be able to draw the connections to those films and their filmakers, so I won't bother to get into that. Should you have seen either of these films and enjoyed them, I suggest you stop reading and immediately rent A SIMPLE PLAN. If not, keep reading and I will try to express why this film is so remarkably brilliant. And why I hope you will take a look at it.A SIMPLE PLAN is, at its core, about four people. And underneath all the plot devices and twists, it's about how they relate to one another. Notice I did't say characters, because this film doesn't have actors simply delivering dialogue. It's about people you get to know, understand and sympathise with as they undergo the most brutal of dilemmas. Sure, finding a mysterious bag filled with money is an excellent plot device, but the heart of this film is much simpler than that. It's about the basic human flaw of committing a criminal act and trying to weasel your way out of it. And being forced to do the most unthinkable things in the process.That's what gives this film such depth. You watch these people try to figure out how to cover every angle so they can get away with stealing a whole lot of cash. And in the end it falls apart for two reasons: the details and the human factor. They say the Devil is in the details and this is never truer than with a crime. As for the human factor, where greed is concerned, people cannot trust one another because they fear the other person's greed while are unable satisfy their own.In many respects this film is almost an homage to BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, but in many ways I think it is superior. I often draw the comparison by a scene which is both A SIMPLE PLAN and BLOOD SIMPLE where a body is increasingly difficult to dispose of. And even afterwards, after the emotional toll the has been taken, once one evil act is committed, another is sure to follow. It's so painfully facsinating to watch a person work out their problem on camera, frantically going over the details in their mind, all the while their heart is beating a mile a minute. Bill Paxton does this better than anyone. He is such a likable man (both in the film and in life) that you can't help but feel sorry for the mess he has created. His entire performance is a balancing act between getting away with a seemingly harmless crime, keeping his partners at bay and their mouths shut while being prodded along by his conspirator wife. That may make them all sound malicious, but really the opposite is actually true. They're all normal folks, like we've all seen a hundred times. And in the end it really gets to you because you can imagine how you would react in the same situations they find themselves in. After all, were you faced with the choice to steal a couple million dollars that no one would miss, what would you do? But then again, nothing is ever that simple	1
"Really does not get the film noir credit it deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale.  Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here.  See Gene in this and in ""Laura"" and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances"	1
I viewed this DVD and would give it a 1 out of 5 stars. This is great if you are in college and researching male dancers or something but otherwise it's kind of lame. It shows about 5 dancers in one club and they interview various women in the club and get their opinions about strippers. I still have not made the connection as to why Ron Jeremy has anything to do with this documentary! Ladies, if you are expecting to see skin, this DVD shows very little. Others may have a limmited   interest if you have followed the male dancer trends in the US.      	0
This is the third DVD from Shawn Trautman that I have gotten (Swing and Cha-Cha are the others), and they are all exceedingly well done.  They start from ground zero and progress in very small steps that are a snap to follow.  By the time it's over, you will understand the logic behind the dance and know enough to do well on a social dance floor.  It will also get you pumped to learned more advanced steps; you won't feel intimidated.  I highly recommend it	1
"I was fourteen years old when I attended the New York Premier of this movie at the Rivoli Theater. I have the original Premier Book from the theater; which is NOT for sale. I immediately fell in love with the beautiful Ingrid Bergman. So did millions of other young men. This movie did not win the award of the year; it was overshadowed by ""Casablanca""; which in my estimation, was of inferior quality, compared to For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Bob Richard"	1
Overall, this is an extremely awesome concert. I am a big fan of DT, and like pretty much all their stuff. The performance itself is pretty good, although the only truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and Jordan's keyboard solo. Other than that they pretty much just play their songs as you hear them on the album. If they had done more special things, it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of 4. Other people complain about how the band really doesnt get into their music during the performance, but  would say they did okay as far as that goes. Sure the singer doesnt get out from behind the mic stand, thats because half the time he is dragging it along with him, although i will say the band overall doesnt really get into it as much as most other metal bands, and thats probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind them. The special features are also pretty good, but i would not buy this concert just for those, backstage footage and things of that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves. Overall, i did think it was pretty cool, and i would recommend buying it if you like Dream Theater or just their genre of music in general	1
I loved this film. The writting, story, special effects, acting, and directing exceed the original. I recomend this film to any fan of the genre	1
This movie is an action/mystery/space/love story with a lot of interesting charecters, And you really get into it. There is little swearing, and half a second of nudity, which doesn't show anything but somebodies backside.    I would recomend this movie.  The ending is a surprise, And there is Cool  Plot Twists	1
I caught some of this on PBS and was beyond appalled that they chose to cast Reba McEntire as Nellie.  Musicals are for people that can sing, not whine and slide their way up to the preferred pitch.  I'm a native of Arkansas, by the way, and it hurts my ears to listen to Reba's voice.  Reba's country treatment of the vocals shows exactly how talentless she is	0
"After enjoying ""Cowboy Bebop"" and ""Samurai Champloo"", someone recommended checking out ""FLCL"" aka ""Fooly Cooly."" If you enjoyed those previous titles, I would suggest steering clear of this particular anime. The art is interesting enough but the story is simply lacking, the characters are completely and utterly undeveloped. It almost seems like they are making fun of you for watching their anime. This the second dvd of three and has 40 minutes of programming. I read somewhere that this was not even a real show and that they threw it together to test out new animation techniques-- if you've seen all 6 episodes and are still wondering ""what the heck was that"" this does not seem to be untrue. Please I strongly suggest you skip watching this program because it is, simply put, garbage. "	0
"Ohm... Ohm... Ohm...Back in 2000, Ellipsis Arts released OHM: The Early Gurus of Electronic Music, a fantastic and essential three CD set tracing the evolution of ""electronica"" from Messiaen, Cage, and Xenakis to Schulze, Eno, and Hassell. This set was recently reissued (as OHM+) along with a bonus DVD, which is thankfully now available separately for those of us who already have the CDs.The OHM+ DVD is jam-packed with over two hours of archival and more recent footage that runs the gamut from engrossing to mildly interesting to unwatchably dull.If seemingly endless ""talking head"" interviews with Milton Babbitt and Bebe Barron are your idea of video entertainment, you've come to the right place. An interview with John Cage digitally altered beyond all recognition? Check. Swirling psychadelic colored dyes right out of a Saucerful of Secrets-era Pink Floyd concert? No problem.There are some tastier goodies to be found on this DVD, however...The segments with Clara Rockmore and Leon Theremin have an appealingly amateurish home movie quality to them. It's also a real treat to see the 1978 footage of underappreciated minimalist guru David Borden and Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company ""on the road"" hauling around their truckload of big old analog synthesizer equipment. Laurie Spiegel is fun to watch as she tinkers with a big grey metal box called a ""Concerto Generator"" with an extremely serious expression on her face. And Alvin Lucier's ""Music for Solo Performer,"" where he hooks up wires to his head and produces sounds using his brainwaves and two tympani, simply must be seen to be believed.The Pixar-ish computer animation accompanying Paul Lansky's ""The Dust Bunny"" is sort of cute, but it goes on for about 10 minutes too long. Surely most of the OHM target audience already has the DVD of Steve Reich's Three Tales, but it's nice that they included the best part - the ominous yet goofy ""Dolly"" segment. Many have also probably seen Hans Fjellestad's documentary Moog before, but the six minute excerpt provided here is really about all you need.It's too bad there isn't a more interesting John Cage segment, and regrettable that there aren't any Stockhausen videos (those would certainly be a riot!)Overall, though, while the OHM+ DVD is not as consistently engaging as the CD set of the same name, it is a worthy companion to it. And if you don't have either of them yet, the complete OHM+ 3-CD & DVD ""special edition"" box set is a no-brainer"	1
Well, at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit. Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining; unfortunately, it is only intermittently so	0
Before I saw this movie I thought I would enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid. However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could give it half a star I would! 	0
"Tim Burton offers the most charmingly off-beat yet visually sumptuous movies in Hollywood.  From his stop-animation work (""The Corpse Bride"") to dark romances (""Edward Scissorhands"") to horror (""Sleepy Hollow""), Burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably - all the right notes are there, but some are played just off-key enough to create the thrill of tension.Perhaps no other director was so suited to film Roald Dahl's most famous work, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" and remain true to the author's vision.  Most people associate the tamer, goofy ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" starring Gene Wilder, with Dahl's tale, but forget that Dahl had a healthy streak of Lemony Snicket sensibility to him.  So it is perfect that Burton makes a darker, more dangerous film for all to enjoy.The visuals in ""Charlie"" are astounding.  The chocolate waterfall and river look like actual liquid chocolate (not the icky brown water of ""Willie Wonka""), and the squirrel-nut-sorting room is a classic of mind-blowing set design.  And that is not all - oh, no, that is not all!Possibly the most visually stunning element in ""Charlie"" is Willie Wonka himself, played by Burton favorite Johnny Depp.  Depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes one with them, and one wonders what inspired Depp's quirky, nervous, mean-spirited, selfish concoction.  Depp plays Wonka as tight as he plays Jack Sparrow loose, and he never misses a note. But whereas Gene Wilder's Willie Wonka was more genial puppetmaster, Depp's Wonka has a sadistic streak in him, perhaps instilled by his dentist father.  This is a great, if much-maligned, performance.The most infamous element from the first movie was the seemingly-drug-inspired presence of the Oompa-Loompas, Wonka's army of diminutive henchmen.  In the Wilder film, the Oompa-Loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance numbers to the irritatingly catchy ""oompa-loompa-do-be-de-do"" tune.  In this version, all the Oompa-Loompas are played by the same character (even though there are hundreds of them), and their dance numbers are even more fantastic.  However, the songs don't have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs, which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their parents as they got eliminated from the contest. Indeed, there are several lyrics that I just couldn't catch in this film version, and that is a pretty major quibble.Far from a feel-good movie, but definitely a good movie, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" deserves to be seen and, for fans of artistic visions, studied.

"The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG), Season One, had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.' Viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed does not show a vision in the shaping as per the TOS series but is more of the same again (even remaking some TOS episodes), this time with more characters, more action and more special effects. SEASON 1All of the main characters in the TNG series are in episode one, Captain Jean-Luc Picard,  Commander William T. Riker,  Lieutenant/Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Tasha Yar, Lieutenant Worf, Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher, Lt. Commander/Commander Deanna Troi, Lt. Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher.  Only Natasha Yar quits before the first season is finished. Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher is replaced by Doctor Katherine Pulaski for Season two. Ensign Wesley Crusher is only sometimes reoccurring after Season four. The Enterprise itself is beautifully rendered with additional areas such as the holodeck allowing for almost any environment at the users choosing, playing an important function in many episodes. The use of computer generated images (a ground-breaking television experience back in 1987!) allowed for inspirational subspace sequences, planets, backdrops, an improved bridge main viewer and windows! Advances in makeup effects brought new alien characters to life and allowed an actor to appear as if he where indeed an android. TNG Season One attempts to relate with TOS by reviving similar stories while at the same time adding on additional insights into new and fascinating sci-fi theory while retaining most of the character arcs that made TOS so interesting. The stories (also written by TOS's DC Fontana) are as fresh today as they where in the late 80s, early 90s, when TNG first aired. Season One of TNG is mostly about deities, infections, alien cultures, galactic politics, time travel, alien forces, mind control, family matters, computer malfunctions and Starfleet Academy. There are also the unforgettable episodes `Encounter at Farpoint' which introduces us to the crew of the Enterprise and the mysterious Q,  `Where No One has Gone Before' a wonderful story about travelling the cosmos, `Datalore' which features two Data characters, `Heart of Glory' with some in-depth revelations about Klingons , `Skin of Evil' featuring some remarkable effects for its time with a very sad ending, and the classic `Conspiracy' (this episode is uncut, which features some violent scenes involving a head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious]) about an invasion of the body snatchers type takeover of Starfleet. The bottom line for TNG: Season One is that it will bring back some enormously delightful memories for those who where awe inspired by it when it first came out. Although we can debate about which is the better series, TNG or TOS, we still absolutely adore both. We might miss Kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume, but hearing Picard saying `make it so' just makes our day.SEASON 2Season Two, still carries on with repeating much of the stories in TOS, revamping them and then adding some new stuff of its own, boosting Data's screen time, bumping up the computer generated graphics to allow for things like shuttlecraft launching and manoeuvres, improved alien CGI and an enhancement in particle effects. They even attempt a type of morphing. Most of the main characters from Season One are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a beard), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow), Commander Deanna Troi (complete with low-cut red starfleet costume), Lt. Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher. However obviously Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar is gone but so is Dr. Beverly Crusher (who was not bad-looking), replaced by Doctor Katherine Pulaski (who looks like your granny!) for Season Two because Dr. Crusher has been reassigned to Starfleet Medical as explained in episode one of Season Three (in reality the TNG writers where having difficulties in developing Crusher's character, would later reinstate her for Season Three, dropping Pulaski because they felt her character was not working). Colm Meaney as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation from Season One gets more screentime, while the new Whoopi Goldberg chatacter, Guinan, is the wise El Aurian bartender in 10 Forward, the new bar room where the Enterprise crew get to relax. Except for this extra area the Enterprise itself has not gone undergone much of a revamp and this season is far more Enterprise based than Season One, or all of TOS, meaning Season Two has less planetary exploration stories which is a bit of a drawback, but sets a new standards in the `hotel in space' feel that would produce the `Deep Space Nine' series. Season Two of TNG is mostly about alien impregnation, mystery space, AI, the holodeck, interplanetary relations, rapid aging, justice, shape-shifting, time travel, family, the prime directive, kidnapping, cloning, war games and infections. The big plus side to not having that much planetary exploration is that there are lots of stories with Klingons and the first encounter with the BORG! The unforgettable episodes are, `Elementary, Dear Data' where Data takes on his Sherlock Holmes persona and we are introduced to the Moriarty character. `Loud as a Whisper' is about a deaf and dumb peace negotiator. `A Matter of Honor' is where Riker serves on a Klingon battleship. `Q Who?' may well be the best episode here because it is the first time we meet the Borg. The last episode of Season Two `Shades of Gray' may be one of the worst Star Trek episodes ever, which uses Riker's memories from Seasons One and Two to make up an entire episode and even includes the uncut scenes for the Season One episode `Conspiracy' featuring the violent head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious again]). The bottom line for TNG: Season Two is that for all it shortcomings because of lack of beaming down, we get the Borg and lots and lots of Klingons. At this stage in the saga we might still miss Kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume, but how will Picard defeat those assimilating half-man, half-machine entities that are heading his way? He better ""make it so"" with Season Three.SEASON 3It was the dawn of the 90s and since CGI had undergone some development, the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence, but with better looking planets (complete with moving gaseous atmospheres) and major enhancements in particle effects. Towards the end it undergoes new model development, lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look. The crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a bigger belly), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow even more), Commander Deanna Troi (with more makeup, costume changes and even an aerobics outfit [that really isn't as good as it sounds]), Lieutenant Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher (new hairdo). Dr. Beverly Crusher is back (initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better) and Doctor Katherine Pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again. Pulaski's disappearance is not officially explained (in reality Diana Muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in L.A. Law instead. McFadden was asked to rejoin the series again) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with Dr. Crusher making reference to Pulaski's work in Episode four. Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode! Dwight Schultz (Murdoch from the A-Team) makes his first appearance as Lieutenant `Reg' Barkley, who would have a reoccurring role. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation, doesn't have much of a role boost since Season Two, while the Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan character of the wise El Aurian, the bartender in 10 Forward, has her background further developed. Season Three of TNG is mostly about nanotechnology, colonization, super aliens, the prime directive, orphans, ancient space booby traps, Romulans, wormholes, peace negotiations, defectors, super humans, terrorism, Q, court inquisitions, parallel universes, AI, Klingon high councils, captivity experiments, time travellers, biological space crafts, morale, the first law of robotics, Vulcans, Sarek, evolutionary speciation, and the Borg. Unlike Season Two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, ""Evolution"" where nanotechnology takes over the Enterprise, ""The Survivors"" is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet, ""Who Watches The Watchers?"" is about the prime directive failing when the Enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped, ""Offspring"" sees Data creating another sentient android, ""Sins of the Father"" has Worf return to his Klingon homeworld to defend his family honour, ""Hollow Pursuits"" has Lt. Barkley fantasizing about crew members in the Holodeck, ""Sarek"" is about the Vulcan of the same name from Star Trek: The Original Series, who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation, and of course the pot-boiler end episode of ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" (widely acclaimed as one of the best Star Trek episodes ever!) marks the grand entrance of Locutus of Borg onto the scene. The bottom line for TNG: Season Three is that it is often cited by fans as the best TNG Season and is probably the first of the Seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. In Season Three everyone seems to have matured, included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie, especially towards the end. There is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" would deliver on, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There is no time to loose!!! Onto Season Four. .... wooosshhhh.SEASON 4Not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" would deliver on at the end of Season III, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There was no time to lose!!! Onto Season Four. .... wooosshhhh... so here we are. With Season Three it was the dawn of the 90s and CGI had undergone some development and improvements (better looking planets with moving gaseous atmospheres, particle effects, lighting and subspace effects). With Season Three things started to have more of a movie budget look. Season Four tries to maintain that class. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (who keeps growing that hair), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data, Dr. Beverly Crusher and Ensign Wesley Crusher (now a Starfleet officer with full uniform, also departs from TNG half way through this Season, and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons). Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien and Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for Season Four such as Worf's lover K'Ehleyr, the Traveller, K'Mpec the Klingon leader, Duras whose dishonesty caused Worf's discommendation and the Romulan Tomalak. There is also a surprise character at the end of this season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Borg, family, Dr. Soong and the AI emotion chip, adoption, the space-time continuum, hostage rescue, the Klingon High Council, Romulans, alternative universes, holographic projection, survival,  loosing special abilities, renegade captains, the devil, amnesia, first contact, love, nightmares, mutations, super intelligence, Robin Hood, witch hunt trials, euthanasia, host life forms, mind control and honour. Like Season Three most the episodes in Season Four have great stories, combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial seasons did. It is a well balanced season overall and a good deal more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that things are firmly established. Apart from containing Part II of `The Best of Both Worlds', the introduction of the Cardassians, who would become major players in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine franchise, makes it even more valuable. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, `The Best of Both Worlds, Part II' concludes the cliff-hanger from Season Three with some great battle special effects, `Family' has Picard going home to see his brother and family, `Brothers' features Dr. Soong who is Data's creator, `Reunion' returns to the story of Worf and his Klingon dishonour, `The Wounded' features the Cardassians for the first time, `Clues' has Data disobeying Picard, `First Contact' sees Riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring, the `The Nth Degree' has Barclay taking control of the Enterprise with his new special powers of intelligence, `QPid' for its historical recreation of Robin Hood and of course `Redemption, Part I' which deals with Worf's dishonour. The bottom line for TNG: Season Four is that it keeps up the pace of Season Three, and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. Everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly what we want. Although not quite the cliff-hanger end episode that ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" was, `Redemption, Part I' still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and introduces the surprise return of a person we know. We are left asking ourselves, if the `hard man' is really gone and why does `she' look like a Romulian! As Picard would say ""I can live with a mystery"" but we just can't! Onto Season Five as quick as we can...SEASON 5Season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects. The display panels on the enterprise are more interactive. The camera can now pan as special effects take place. Deep space battles seem more intense. We also get a new Star Trek title graphic in the opening sequence. The cliff-hanger conclusion of ""Redemption, Part II"" is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between Klingons, Romulans and the Federation, turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get. None-the-less, it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of Tasha Yar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (with a new red suede coat and grey uniform), Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge (who sports a new beard in one episode), Lieutenant Commander Worf (who left the Enterprise in Season Four), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien as is Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Alexander Rozhenko as Worf's son now has a reoccurring role since Season Four. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) is firmly established as a reoccurring character. Watch out for the special appearances of Ashley Judd as Ensign Robin Lefler and Leonard Nimoy as Spock! Whoot! Whoot! Strangely enough this is the only season where Q, of the omnipotent Q Continuum, does not make an appearance. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is also absent from this Season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Klingon High Council, Romulans, communication, Bajora, crystalline entities, disasters, addiction, reunification, time travel, parenting, telekinesis, eugenics, amnesia, possession, euthanasia, sexual repression, time warps, children, cover-ups, sexual attraction, imaginary friends, Borg, invisibility, alternative lives and phase shifting. Like Season Four most the episodes in Season Five have great stories, a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew. It much more of the same as in Season Four with the better episodes being `Redemption, Part II', `Darmok' an interesting episode about language, the introduction of the Bajora and Ensign Ro, the Silicon Avatar makes a return, `Unification', Part I and II (both here) with Spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole TNG franchise, certainly more popular than `Time's Arrow', Part I which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to Data on Earth. `The Masterpiece Society' shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world. Huge of Borg also makes his first appearance in `I, Borg'. Apart from the `Unification' double episode, the instalments `Ethics', about Worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and `The Game', when entertainment becomes mind control, have both achieved cult status as some of the best TNG episodes ever aired. Season Five unfortunately has some dull episodes too, many of which occur in the second half of the season, so the best stuff is within the first four discs. It doesn't really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with Season Six, but no doubt because Six is as good as Five was, then we are there for it. As a note: ""Redemption part II"" - this episode received as 12 age rating in the UK, because it contains Klingon ritual head butting. `Violations' also has sexually violent content (psychic rape). Parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children. If you are going to move onto Season Six then you will probably want to know that during Season Six the crew make contact with Deep Space Nine. So if you get Deep Space Nice: Season One you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order. If you are in for Six you may also be in for Season One of DS9!SEASON 6Season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the Season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that Star Trek, Deep Space Nine: Season 1 whipped up while Season 6 was running. 1993 was TV Sci-Fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of ST for the year. This means for the folks who have been watching TOS and TNG, now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between TNG Season 6 and DS9 Season 1. You can find the order if you search the new for it. TNG has really good stories while DS9 gets the effects. We are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story. Season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises (Picard acting like a Russian is hysterical. Would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time? Maybe yes!). The conclusion of ""Time's Arrow"" is not the best cliff-hanger but sufficient. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien but will be transferred to DS9 (his absence is not mentioned). Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan is back along with Alexander Rozhenko. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) will also leave for DS9. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is back after being absent from Season 5. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about transporter psychosis, empaths, Scotty!, alien abductions, Q, age regression, android dreams, artificial life, Cardassians, Prof. Moriarty, love, Romulan defection, destiny, Klingon birthrights, thieves, command ethics, origins of life, insanity, murder, faith, doubles, time travel and the Borg. Like Season 5 most the episodes in Season 6 have above average sci-fi stories, combing planetary exploration and the life of the crew. Memorable episodes include, A Fistful of Datas, The Quality of Life, Ship in a Bottle, Face of the Enemy, Birthright and lessons. There are three very good episodes which really make the season worth. Tapestry sees Picard given the opportunity to relive his youth without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through the heart. Suspicion is a great whodunit episode (of which there are a few) with one of the coolest Star Trek aliens ever (should have made him a main character). Descent Part I is a very nice slight of hand trick. You will keep thinking Hugh right up until the last second.SEASON 7Star Trek: Season 7 is of course winding down to a conclusion, making way for some Star Trek films, but in reality it is Deep Space Nine: Season 2 (DS9: Season 1 starts in star date chronological order with TNG: Season 6) that is the new trek. Fans of Star Trek got their twofold measure of these series through 1993 and 1994 making it an exceptional SF TV era. The conclusion of ""Descent, Part II"" has the finale of Lore. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for one episode. While Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran, was supposed to replace him, she only appears in one episode in Season 7, although the episode is a major one focused on her. Colm Meaney shows up again as Miles Edward O'Brien for the last episode. Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan is gone without explanation (see the movie ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" on her). Alexander Rozhenko is back. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) is not here either (after leaving for DS9). Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer, is back again. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about Lore, emotional studies, interfaces, mercenaries, nightmares, psychic trauma, Beverly and Picard, warp travel environmental damage, data's mother, alternate realities, the Pegasus, Worf's human brother, incubus, top secret missions, radiation sickness, deities, Troi and Worf, reverse evolution, Wesley and the Traveller, Klingon right of ascension, Picard's son, abiogenesis, Ro Laren and time travel. While there are some hit and miss episodes and a really terrible one (""Masks"" for example is one of the worst of the entire franchise) most are well above average and some are incredible. Memorable episodes include, Gambit, Forces of Nature, Inheritance, Lower Decks, Thine Own Self, Journey's end and Bloodlines. The Pegasus is probably the best episode of the Season, but the finale ""All good things..."" is really where it is at with some good aging effects, a possible future with an older looking cast and an futuristic Enterprise to die for. The series ends very warmly and with a nicer note about the possibilities of looking within instead of charting stars and galaxies for a newer greater trek. In short there is nothing like ST:TNG. It evolved TV serials into mega media and ran for a full span of 7 years. It set a new benchmark and placed the bar as high as the stars. All we can say about this awe-inspiring series can be summed up in one word... ...AMEN. "	1
i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here,so i was upset when i watched this sad movie. gary graham(t.v.'s alien nation) is a robot jox,which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought! the f/x are not very good and the story is paper thin,only the acting is good,but it can't save this one from being just a let down. skip it	0
"Someone named ""NDB"" (and I'm willing to bet a princely sum of money that he goes by ""NDBoston"" in certain other online venues...ahem) hit it right on the head.  There is no curse.  There never was.  Glad that the phantasm of a curse managed to put Dan Shaughnessy's kids through college OK, but the Red Sox have had damned good reasons why they've lost over the years, and none of them has to do with ghosts, specters, curses or other figments of the imagination.None of which takes away from the unbridled joy that we all feel in Red Sox Nation at this wonderful, beautiful championship.  (By the way, NDB, Shank is still gonna prime that pump.  Check this site for enthralling details of the windy-titled ""Legend of the Curse of the Bambino,"" due to hit stores in May, and deep-discount racks in July or August at the latest.)"	0
"I remember way back in '80 when this movie was the buzz of Hollywood. That is, the buzz on Johnny Carson.  The media killed this movie before anybody had the chance to judge it for itself.Yet, in the mid 80's, it came out on both Betamax and VHS, and naturally I bought me a Beta copy to judge for myself what kind of a movie it was.First, it is not a drive in movie or one made for mass consumption.  It is long and intraclly woven together.  it is lavish and sometimes loud.  It is a brutal slap in the face to ""Manifest Destiny"" and a cruel dig to the sickos that even today claim that this is ""God's"" country.  As if their 'God"" gave them wealth and privilige and that this God justifies revolution, massacre and war.Many comparisons can be mase with the America of the late 19th century and the America ruled presently by King George W. and his robber barons of Capitalism.  But it is now, as then, much more conveniant to steer the ""common man"" into their churches, into their army,  into their lies.  The enemy is those ""illegal aliens"" those in the ""gay agenda,"" those who dare to investigate or challenge the status quo.  Kris Kristofferson plays a mayor/sherriff if wealth and means who (shock-shock) sides with the common man and the undertrodden.  When another of his ""breeding and class"" challenges him on why he stands up for the underdogs and not his own class, he replies to the creep:  ""You are not of my class, to be of my class you first have to die and be born again!""This is a revolutionary movie, meant to be savored, each and every minute of it.  This movie dares you to look at  things usually not into history books or shown on the History Channel"	1
I'm not a fan of Stephen King film adaptations.  The only one I like is Carrie bec it was directed by Brian DePalma and featured terrific performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie.  Cujo is boring and not all that suspenseful.  I couldn't wait for it to end.  Not worth purchasing.  Okay as a rental	0
The is a tragic but very true to life depiction of the degradation caused by addiction to individuals, families, and society. The film is graphic in its depiction of addiction, but as an addiction counselor, who is an addict and alcoholic in recovery, it is very close to actual tragic events I have seen in the world of addiction. The emotionally disturbing events that take place in the lives of the main characters are exactly the very real things that addiction counselors are seeking to prevent. These events are the end of untreated or unchecked addiction for far too many. Unfortunately, even though some of the content may be offensive to some, it is a starkly true depiction of what the reality for some addicts becomes. Even though the film may leave one emotionally upset for a time, it is a worthwhile film to break through false pretenses about addiction's final results and the glossing over of the degradation addiction can and does lead to in real life. Watch and learn the truth about severe addiction	1
"I grew up with the original DS.  I also saw the two ""spin off"" movies: ""House of Dark Shadows"" and ""Night of Dark Shadows.""  Needless to say I was extremely excited about the ""revival,"" and I wasn't disappointed.  I felt that Dan Curtis was actually able to improve upon the original, by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove.  The original Barnabus was played by Jonathan Frid who was a Shakespearian trained actor and, Ben Cross is a member of the Royal Shakespearian Theatre in London.  I loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual, which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth.  And I must say this series lived up to my every expectation.  Dan Curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera.  I looked forward to 3:30 every day after school.  It's too bad that the Gulf War killed it.  Yes it did!  I was there.  After the Sunday, Monday miniseries, that Friday was to air the first ""episode.""  However it was pre-empted by coverage of the War.  Too, too bad.  I taped it, but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over.  I am so glad to know that I can order it now in it's magical entirety.  I'm ordering it right now!  Thank you Amazon!!!!!!!If you are a fan of things that go bump in the night, you will LOVE this series!!!!"	1
The movie is a brillant mix of drama, love, and comedy. The casting was brillant with greats like Judd and Bullock.In the movie we are introduced to Siddalee Walker a women who has made her mother Vivianne mad. Vivianne always seemed heartless and distant to Sidda and when Sidda tells a reporter about her mother some things get twisted out of proportion and printed the wrong way, which makes Vivi mad. Enter the Ya-Ya's three of Vivi's friends. They feel that Sidda should know the truth about her mother and maybe she would understand. So they kidnap Sidda and start to tell her about her mother. We learn that Vivi wasn't well liked by her own mother and was seen as a bad person by her mother. Then we learn that Vivi's first love whom she never got over was killed at war which is why she hates her husband. Sidda then starts to question her current realationship thinking she'll be a bad mother and calls off her wedding. Phase two of the Ya Ya's plan. They must tell Sidda something about her mother that will change everything.Very good plot that will make you cry and laugh at the same time. This would be a good one to watch with friends or mothers.Penny Lan	1

I used to think he was great, till I caught the Director's Cut of 'Das Boot.'  All of a sudden you're confronted with this ridiculous synthesizer music that wasn't in the original, and the spell is broken.  Let's not even talk about 'Air Force One.'  Now I've seen 'The Perfect Storm' twice, and I own the book, but I still haven't read it because I'm reasonably sure the book MUST suck if the movie is this bad.  And I'm sorry New England, but what are Gloucestermen anyways, except for great rapers of the high seas?  What will they NOT do for a buck, you might ask.  Ok, they are not as bad as the Japanese, but they all stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there's no tomorrow.  Watching this movie definitely made me take fish off the menu.  Sure you will find excitement aplenty, amped up to eleven.  Even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder the plight of seafarers throughout history.  I even like some of the principal actors, but in the end all they do is make a pretty bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be.  This just doesn't stand up to repeat viewings.  Unless you enjoy feeling like a sucker.  Do you	0
"I loved ""The RM"" and expected the same level out of this movie, but my husband's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest.  The teenagers didn't even want to check it out after that scene.  They also loved ""The RM"".  If you can get it from the library go ahead, but don't spend money on it"	0
I can't wait to see the original film again. I remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea. Thus was born the inspiration for the great PC game, Lemmings. Yes, I know that the lemmings were 'manipulated' into suicide. Nevertheless I love this movie. I hope that they don't cut the lemming sequence. Disney has promised a full restoration. Other animals that left a strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being blasted with an Arctic blizzard. The hardships of an Arctic existence were beautifully photographed	1
This is one of the best G3s.  Maybe even the best.  I would have said that it was definitely the best if not for Mr.Malmsteen - the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales.But *I* don't want to be nice.  I want to be absolutely and unequivocally cruel when it comes to Malmsteen.He knows alternate picking, I'll give him that.  But then, so do I - and a million others.  He shouldn't be up there playing with Vai and Satriani solely because he can alternate pick faster than most (not all) people .  And yet he is.He shows over and over again, in this show, that the only thing he can do with the guitar is shred and shred and shred some more.  That's all. One of the interesting things about this DVD is that one cannot really measure the time between two consecutive shredding runs that Yngwie chooses to execute - it's less than about a second.  And this is an *average* figure.Enough about Yngwie, though he is the reason I'm writing this review - Satriani is absolutely amazing, as usual, with a brand new rendition of 'Midnight' and a nice solo at the end of 'Starry Night'.Vai, though, steals the show.  This coming from a guy who prefers Satriani.  But I can't help it - he is really that good.  And better.  'I Know You're Here'(which he plays on a triple neck Jem) contains at least seven new approaches to the same old things that you're taught at guitar school.  It is also the best song Steve Vai has ever written after 'Fire Garden Suite'. 'Juice' and 'I'm the Hell Outta Here' are also really really really good.Overall, a great DVD, though you should probably skip the parts with Yngwie in it	1
DENNIS LEARY IS HAILED AS SOME GREAT ANGRY YOUNG MAN WHO IS TRYING TO BRING THE WORLD TO RIGHTS. PERSONALLY I PREFER BILL HICKS. AT LEAST WHEN BILL DID IT HE WAS BEING ORIGINAL!!!!!!!

SITTING IN FRONT OF A FEW LIVE VIDEOS OF A GREAT MAN AND TAKING NOTES DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL EVER BE ONE DENNIS!DEFINATELY A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS COVERS BANDS...STICK TO THE ACTING DENNIS	0
"This is a surprisingly poor movie. Although it has some well-known actors, and a notable director, the material was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late night TV-movie with profanity inserted to liven it up.The movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings (though legitimate in many cases). It also glosses over the grieving process of the family, ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child, overdoes Kiefer Sutherland's character flaws (which are considerable nevertheless), and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title.In one particularly-bad scene, after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically, Sally's character simply stares open-mouthed and dumbfounded at Keifer's character when they meet on the street and he talks to her.I don't know what I missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers like so much. I only see wide-spread mediocrity.I would only recommend this for fans of Keifer. ""Ssssssorry"", Sally, not your best role or movie. Ditto Ed Harris, whose other movies I generally like."	0
"This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new ""teen speak"" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out."	0
"Hey...this is a great DVD with great packaging--definitely one of the best that I've seen, and there is a lot of extras. Definitely a must-have for He-Man and She-Ra fans! I just got an e-mail stating that the distributor of He-Man will be releasing She-Ra on DVD, starting July 11. That release will be ""The Secret of the Sword"" and five other episodes deemed most popular by fans. After that, in the fall they will release the complete 93 episodes in three separate volumes within the next 12 months. For anyone who wants to see for themselves, go to tvshowsondvd.com and look at the news for She-Ra. I hope you are as excited as I am"	1

"As I stated before, I have a fabulous thing called ""Digital Cable"". One night I was flippin through the channels and this movie was on. I could only watch so much of it before I had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off. Sometimes that happens with ""Digital Cable"", but it usually it will right itself in the end. As I watched for about a half an hour I could not take it anymore. I tried everything to fix it including switching channels, turning on and off the TV, and things of that nature. I even went as far as calling Comcast and complaining, but even that was a wasted effort. I eventually had to turn it off because I was a hairs-width away from haymakering Morris. Well, even though Comcast ruined my viewing experience so far, when I was at Blockbuster I decided to give it another chance. I know I mentioned that the lead actor could not act but I thought I could look past this, because it might not be completely his fault. For one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices, or it might be because it's his first movie. Who knows but Howard's mind was made up. ""Rumble in the Bronx"" was to be rented. From what I saw so far on ""Digital Cable"", I possibly found a person I could call my mentor, when I enter the world of stuntmen. When I returned home I threw the DVD in the DVD Player and guess what? The DVD was messed up as well, the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on ""Digital Cable"". I raced back to Blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy, telling them this DVD was broken. I returned home again and tried to watch it. ""WHAT THE HECK!?"" I yelled, ""IS THE WORLD AGAINST HOWARD TUTTLEMAN!?"" You guessed it that DVD was messed up as too. I even tried it out on another DVD Player and it proved to me that the run of DVDs Blockbuster has were all messed up. I got so frustrated that I threw the DVD out the window (I rented it on my father's card so there is no recourse to me). After I cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica, I was still determined to see this movie. I ran up to Best Buy in Troy, and I found a copy. I asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version, hoping that it was a new pressing. I was happy with his answer and purchased it. Well I returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop. I put the DVD in the DVD Player and dimmed the lights. Finally, Tuttleman will have his moment. Well to keep this clean and short, let me say that, that night ended with a baseball bat, three (3) stitches in my hand, a broken window, and a hefty grounding-sentence(we are talking WEEKS here). In Conclusion, some movies can't be good, no matter how cool the stuntman, this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it could possibly start a riot. Later. "	0
"What a disaster. Stay away from this film. I was so disappointed--how could this have won the Academy Award?! The story is rambling and confused, as if the filmmakers couldn't decide what story they wanted to tell. The animation is very average, with the exception of a few striking scenes of natural landscapes. In fact, those all-important ""happy feet"" of the main character just kind of jerk and slide around a bit. (That's supposed to be tap-dancing? that's supposed to be ""animation?"") The jokes aren't particularly funny (with the exception of a few moments in the middle where Robin Williams briefly shines). And oddly enough for a film whose central conceit centers on music and dancing, there's not a single original song, or even an inspired remake of any of the songs. Think ""Billy Elliot"" meets ""The March of the Penguins"" with some  of Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" mixed in--without any of the wit, charm, intelligence, passion, or beauty in any of those films. (Did I mention that this film is a disaster?)Perhaps most annoyingly, like the rest of the story, the underlying political message alternates between cliched, confused, and heavy-handed. The ending is especially unbearable, with its tacked-on feel and absurd psuedo-environmentalist feel-good solution. What a joke! Personally, I consider myself quite liberal and sympathetic to environmentalist positions (I've been a vegetarian for more than 20 years, and a member of Sierra Club and PETA, for example), yet the way this movie presents its misguided message offended me greatly--not least because of the utter inconsistency and incomprehensibility of the message.One final note for those of you with children: this is not really a kids movie. Most of the jokes won't be understood by children under 15. For kids under 6, all this feeble film offers is some too-scary ""Shamus"" (orcas), a terrifyingly ferocious sea lion inexplicably made to growl like a dinosaur and given outsized teeth in a deformed mouth, and a jarring ending that suddenly switches to live-action scenes where adults heatedly debate environmental action in such kid-friendly forums as the United Nations! (What the heck?!) After sitting through the entire film to this point, my four-year-old son finally turned to me and quietly said, ""This is not a movie for me.""  I couldn't have agreed more"	0
In 2 weeks, I will actually be at the Vatican for my first visit.This wonderful DVD showed me places and things that I will never be able to see as a tourist, but just knowing about the workings of the Vatican will add such a richness of knowledge to visit.  This is a beautifully done 90 min DVD as only National Geographic could have done.  I was thrilled with every minute I spent watching it and will enjoy watching it many more time when I get home --- to remember my trip. 	1
Orange County as a movie tries to play it safe. The Director tries to be in tow with what he believes is a good film. I must say for around 50% of the film I was laughing. Jack Black is truly my favourite character in the film. Colin Hanks,the lead actor, is a boring sophisticated person.He also plays Black's brother in the film.Although Jack Black doesnt have a huge role in it, everytime he's on the screen I seem to forget all the other characters around. I thought the scene in which he jumps into the swimming pool with just his under-shorts was funny. But I defintely feel there are some seven other scenes featuring this master of crazy comedy.I didnt find Colin Hanks(in the film) inspiration inspiring at all and think he should have gone to Stanford.For the simple reason I believe he didnt have much enough at Orange County to wait for.But then that's a story flaw or story strength(however you perceive it) Come to think of it Colin Hanks character was extremely realistic,polite and believable.Now all the credit in the world to the director for this.However,it was the drugged Jack Black who really tries to get him into something.Ive seen School Of Rock and I'm sorry for I did not like it as much as I liked Orange County.It's the presence of Jack Black that does it for me.I've seen the film 4 times which is probably why I can't stand Hanks and his goodness.Anyhow,forget all that , watch the film - rent it , steal it, buy it,download it....just give it a watch.Cheers	1
"This film starts with an event based on a true crime. A talk radio show host in Denver was killed by an American Nazi. (This event inspired the ""Talk Radio"" play and film.) This film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region. No mention of their economic status; are they losing dollars and population, small businesses, etc. Instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him! This seems too exaggerated to believe. Federal agents are aware of this but don't want to act yet. Their agent is sent back to get more information. There are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas. The film doesn't explain what created them. It shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions. No real names, of course.The Federal agent meets to report to her higher ups. Then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities (based on real events). Most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group. (The FBI put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s.) This Federal agency doesn't interfere because they want more information on their aims (and their leaders). More terrorism is planned: dynamiting a courthouse, attacking a power station, etc. The terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day! Kathy finds a secret list of ""friends"". This is quickly copied with a camera. The Federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them. Gary meets with the leader (who arrives in a helicopter!) And shows documents that say Kathy is a special investigator. Is Kathy being served up as a sacrifice? Gary and Kathy travel to Chicago, where an assassination is planned that will make Gary the fall guy. (Another Lee Harvey Oswald?) A second ""lone gunman"" shoots the politician in front of a building. Gary fails to shoot, and won't ever try this again.Costa-Gavras gained world fame with his 1969 film ""Z"". A few years later his film about rebels in South America was popular. His later films have seemed mediocre. A better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does; better pacing could help. The threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film (e.g., Timothy McVeigh). Those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts.A better film today would show the bad results from ""NAFTA"" and ""Free Trade"" in harming most Americans economically. But Hollywood would never allow a film about this ""war on the middle class"". The word `nafta' in Greek and Arabic refers to `petroleum'. NAFTA is a symbol for the policies designed for Big Oil. It is like George W. Bush calling his policy ""Operation Iraqi Liberation""."	0

"I knew that this concert DVD was an acoustic show so I wasn't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning. But to start the show with Gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much. Once he did start playing, Gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that I found myself praying for the drums to kick in. By the time things settle down, the really glaring problem with this DVD comes to the surface. The mix is horrible. The crowd noise drowns out Gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize, he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the ""concert experience"".There are high points in the show, but the low points are rock bottom. Comfortably Numb is a song that millions of people know by heart. Two versions are provided on this DVD - from the concert and in the bonus section. Neither of the guest singers (Robert Hewitt and Sir Bob Geldoff) know the words, have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before. Gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience. The very best thing on this DVD is, oddly enough, in the bonus section. Screamin' Jay Hawkins' I Put a Spell on You, a blues standard performed with Mica Paris and Jools Holland, almost makes the DVD worth buying. Almost. Watch Jonathan Demme's beautiful treatment of Neil Young: Heart of Gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show. That is the gold standard."	0
This workout is nice because it doesn't mess around.  There are no long introductions you can't fast-forward through and the workout itself is challenging both the abdominal and breath series and the side series (which is all legs and hips) are really challenging and I plan on doing them to keep my muscles toned even after delivery.  One complaint is that apparently she releases the videos herself and they aren't available very widespread in retail stores.  I also would have liked it if they had included more arm work or a postnatal workout.  All in all though great	1
"I can't believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video ""easy to master"".  I found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow.  The camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork!  I am an athletic twenty-three year old girl who is not a slow learner.  I just excercised with this DVD for the first time and it was really tough!  I didn't get a work out at all because I was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much.  She doesn't break down the moves at all and it's just so much more confusing than it needs to be.  The dances are cute, but it's frustrating that she doesn't explain the moves.  I hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing"	0
"I had read--with delight--the book called ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH"" to my grandsons, so I thought the movie would be a nice followup.Wrong!

.. with an all-star cast. The plot is not new(Stage Door, How to Marry a Millionaire and Valley of the Dolls to mention but a few), but Judy, Hedy and Lana do an admirable job. Never mind highbrow critcs; Hedy Lamarr wasn`t THAT bad and Lana does one of her best acting jobs ever. Judy is a tomboy and it`s sad that life eventually took her into the direction of Lana`s character Sheila.The musical numbers are good, but sadly;  footage from THE GREAT ZIEGFELD are edited in(note the finale). James Stewart are good as well - as are Edvard Everett Horton, Charles Winninger and Eve Arden. The film is filled with good 1-liners and there are even echoes of Garbo`s first sound-entrance in ANNA CHRISTIE	1

"Where to begin?  Cliched. Pretentious. Flat. Static. Maudlin. Melodramatic. Homophobic. And finally, just plain BORING.  Start with an over-the-top caricature of a deaf-mute Patsy Cline young drag queen arriving the big city, pile on cardboard ""colorful"" characters like typical AIDS patient, porno star, and loud-mouthed Latina hot mamna, and whaddya get?  An amateur film populated with some of the most UNLIKABLE, UNATTRACTIVE characters ever, all spewing some of the unbelievably BAD dialogue ever written - and to think the (formerly talented) director made THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD also with D'Onofrio? Go figure.  Nice cover art, though"	0
"I don't know how this skunk got 4 and 1/2 stars on Amazon let alone one!  I could hear Hepburn, Bogart and Holden rolling over with a resounding boom.  I think this is mainly because of Ford's Linus.  He is a very unsympathetic character in this remake.  The film critics said that, while the original Sabrina was about her transformation, this version was about Linus' transformation.  But here Linus shows no transformation that you can really see.  His explanation to Sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end- ""There was a merger, and you were in the way.  No hard feelings"" is very cold compared with Bogart's ""Would you believe I enjoyed every minute of it?""  In the original, you get the feeling that Sabrina gets the right man; you don't get that here at all"	0
Undoubtedly the worst 'Best Of' DVD ever made, even if someone gives this DVD as a gift you should punch that person in the face...after watching this DVD I felt like burning down the company that made this DVD . If you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this DVD to him as a gift. There might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror, but it can't be for the actual DVD. There aren't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds. Shame on the band for putting this out. Obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a 'Best Of' on DVD.  This item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture. My taped videos on VHS from MTV and VH1 sound and look better than these ones, really. This essay in amatuerism may have some interest. For worse, is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90's to 2000. 'Love Is Blindness', 'Walk On', 'Elevation' and several alternative videos were edited out. Didn't they have another filmed version of 'Gone'?. Mexico City 1997 was just a below average performance. Shame on U2 for keep going with 'Gone' from that bad shaped Bono's rough night. I still dont understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song. Im talking about 'Until The End Of The World'. In case you dont know, THERES an actual video clip from that song. Rather, they just put the well known Sidney 1993 version here.Rumors say they're going to release a DVD Boxset by late this year. I really don't want 'remastered' versions of shows we've been watching for even 22 years. Rather, I'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage. Just in case, here's a list of several unreleased PRO-SHOT filmed concerts from early 80's to Pop Mart Tour (I didn't include Elevation because there're 2 DVD's out there from the same Tour). Cheers 1- Belfast 23-01-1981 (AWESOME CONCERT!) 2- Berlin 04-11-1981 (Great Goncert) 3- New York 22-11-1981 (Good Concert) 4- Hattem 14-05-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!) 5- Roskilde 02-07-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!) 6- Devore 03-05-1983 (Great Concert) 7- St. Goarshausen 20-08-1983 (AWESOME CONCERT!) 8- Dortmund 21-11-1984 (AWESOME CONCERT!) 9- Montreal 27-03-1985 (Great Concert) 10-Los Angeles 18-11-1987 (AWESOME CONCERT!) 11-Dublin 31-12-1989 (AWESOME CONCERT!) 12-Stockholm 11-06-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!) 13-Washington 16-08-1992 (Great Concert) 14-Anaheim 14-11-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!) 15-Dublin 28-08-1993 (AWESOME CONCERT!) 16-Adelaide 16-11-1993 (Great Concert) 17-Rotterdam 18-07-1997 (AWESOME CONCERT!) 18-Sao Baulo 31-01-1998 (Great Concert) 19-Santiago 11-02-1998 (AWESOME CONCERT!)

Brosnan is great, Kinnear is really funny, a gem of a movie	1
"Georges Seurat was totally insane by the age of 32.  Knowing that helps Stephen Sondheim's genius show through. Sunday in the Park with George is an amazing show about the life of this manic artist, and the fictional personalities of the figures in his painting ""A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte"". The first Act is completely devoted to a set of Sundays spanning 2 years of Seurat's life and the end of his relationship with a long-time lover. The dramatic and touching songs make you feel for this hard-nosed painter yet comical points shine through. The second act takes place 100 years later in 1984 with the Great-grandson of Georges (also played by Mandy Patinkin) doing a tribute to the painting that brought his relative so much posthumous fame. Like other Sondheim shows it is at times long-winded, but altogether entirely enjoyable. Mandy and Mrs. Peters' voice have so much emotion and power that, with the correct sound system, you are carried to the brink of pure delight and insanity by their performances. With Commentary from the actors and producers this is an essential for one who collects musicals"	1
I mean that statement in two ways. First, in my humble opinion, this is Martin Scorcese at his finest. This is better than Goodfellas by a wide margin. All of the regulars give awesome performances in this (even Sharon Stone, who I can't stand!). If you like mafia pictures, this is the BEST one to own. I also mean that it's a great picture due to the fact that it's on HD-DVD. The picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the lights of Las Vegas really jump out of the television. It's almost 3-D ! The extras are ample, but I'd say adequate. That's the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. There is the obligitory commentary, deleted scenes, and a couple featurettes. It's all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae ! I do like that you can watch the extras and the movie at the same time with commentary running. This and Batman Begins are the reasons you should own an HD DVD player ! Note: I have the HD DVD drive attached to my Xbox 360 and it works brilliantly !	1
"This documentary on the life of Louis Armstrong, one of the major proponents of the jazz genre of music, is a quick look at how Louis Armstrong developed into a jazz musician as a vocalist, trumpeter, band leader, and arranger.'Louis Armstrong - Satchmo' starts with Louis's life growing up in New Orleans and how he spent much of his time in an orphan home playing in a band, which is where his skill had room to take off.  The documentary follows his move to Chicago and his involvement in the early jazz recordings.The DVD contains excerpts of live performances and also tracks Louis Armstrong's gradual but swelling rise to fame and how he attained the nickname ""Satchmo"".  Louis, with his love for performing, became a famous musical figure and eventually had the rare achievement of being featured as a performer in many movies.  The docu-biography reveals how Louis never lost his lovable, down-to-earth manner, even with the increased size of his audience.  Louis was just Louis, and he would always be loved for his smile, his lovable personality, and of course his music.  Containing interviews with Tony Bennett and Wynton Marsalis, 'Louis Armstrong - Satchmo' is a pleaser about a jazz player's rise to become an enormously famous popular entertainer.  And he never lost his charm.  We love you, Louie"	1
Do not buy this item if you have any appreciation for video transfer.  On many of the movies the sound and video quality is terrible. On several movies it looks like someone made the video transfer from videotaping the movies while watching them on television.  Don't make the mistake I made.  In hindsight, I would only purchase this collection if I found it in a dollar bin sale, which is most likely where these Mill Creek collections will be in a year or so.	0
"I really enjoyed this movie. Not the typical ""John Boy"" movie. I have not seen the original, although I have recently purchased it. I will be able to make a better comparison once I have seen it. By itself, however, it holds it's own"	1
"The first Wayne's World provides all the necessary background, but Number 2 is actually better because it has a longer list of interesting cameo appearances, including starkly realistic versions of Jim Morrison and Sammy Davis, Jr., spoofing the Oliver Stone film ""JFK"", in the desert"	1
"We all know the movie and story of The Silence Of The Lambs. I reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star rating because to me, it is one of the best films ever made. Now, with Red Dragon, I give it 4 stars but I think this is a very good movie and what makes it so good is.... Anthony Hopkins, the brilliant actor who plays Hannibal Lecter. I don't think this movie would have been as good if Hopkins wouldn't have played the role of Lecter. I own the original Manhunter, which is an older movie and it was good but Hopkins can not be beat for the Hannibal Lecter role. This is a great thriller film!! Edward Norton delivers a very good performance as retired FBI agent Will Graham. When a series of serial killing style murders start, Graham is called out of retirement to help the FBI catch the killer known as ""The Tooth Fairy"". He eventually seeks the aid of Lecter to help him find who this killer is. Like Silence Of The Lambs, we find Graham visiting Lecter in his maximum security facility. Very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and violence. This movie holds true to the book with the same name. We get to see Lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in S.O.T.L. Without going further into all the details of the movie, I'll just say this is a great prequel although it came after S.O.T.L. and the movie Hannibal. Also, Ralph Fiennes delivers a good performance as the Red Dragon. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, it's a must see!!!!"	1
Backing up the review that pointed out M. Night Shyamalan's earlier films the other movie is titled Praying With Anger(also did screen play for Stuart Little). All three movies in the box set are great and worth watching again and again	1
i bought this dvd collection to use in a presentation i made for a graduate school class to complement a book review of murrow. this collection is facinating for people who love murrow and those who've never seen his work. i will use this collection in future presentations that i'll make to my students as a professor. EVERY PERSON IN BROADCASTING SHOULD BUY THIS COLLECTION AND WATCH IT to get a great look at the man who innovated our business	1
Awful...Truly awful.  Joanne Sellar and Daniel Lupi (producers of Boogie Nights and Hard Eight) should be ashamed of themselves and so should the Weinsteins for producing this piece of crap	0
Shekhar Kapur's vision of A.E.W. Mason's The Four Feathers is well done visually, but unfortunately much of the original story is lost to create a more fast-paced and action-packed plot. While the basic story is kept, many small details seem to have been needlessly changed. For those who don't know, The Four Feathers is supposedly about Harry Feversham, a man enlisted in the army. When Harry is informed he will be sent to war in the Sudan, he hides this information and quietly resigns from the army to be with his fianc, Ethne. However, life with Ethne is soon changed when he receives three white feathers from his army colleagues. Explaining to Ethne what he has done and that the feathers are a symbol of cowardice do not help Harry; in fact, she tears a feather out of her fan to make four feathers. Harry then sets out to regain the lost respect of his friends through helping them, in an ultimate goal to regain the respect of Ethne.For the most part, only minor details are changed from the novel to the movie; for example, the way that Harry's friend, Jack Durrance goes blind, or the fact that Harry disguised himself as a Greek, not as an Arab. The change that seems most prominent, however, is the fact that in the film, Jack Durrance knows of Harry's resignation from the beginning. This subverts the whole quest that Jack undertakes to find out the truth in the novel. In addition, the entire `battle' between the warden of the House of Stone of Omdurman and Harry and Abou Fatma was created solely for action value in the film. However, despite this addition of action, the movie still seems to drag at points.Films are almost never completely accurate when following a novel; that is why they are only based on them. However, as I've said, a lot of the changes made seem senseless. I would recommend this film to someone who has not read the book or who does not mind liberal film interpretations of novels, if they have an hour or two to waste. Those looking for a movie to keep them on the edge of their seats would be advised to find something else.	0
I'm not a golfing buff, but found the story and golf very good.I enjoyed this movie very much	1
An even though it's fiction, the incidents seem to fall out of the movies context to become contrived. Boring nonsence on a teen hormone kick	0
I gotta say this movie is an example of a terrible idea, Swain husband beats the crap outta her and she spends her time running from him. What's worse his friend is a lunatic who want swain's character. Swain's Character is a hillbilly who like's an upper class doctor who she really never connects with, I never really got why Swain settled for a lunatic when she was trying to find inner peace thru the whole movie. This movie puts a bad taste in my mouth, it was a waste of my time it wasnt a story it was an excuse to make a bad movie. (Do not buy)	0
I loved the first one and I think, with the logic and plot of the first one, this follows through. We knew they changed the world, and in this sequel we see that. The actors do a good, since the lead characters are suppose to be, let's say less intelligent, but nice. I think this movie and the 1st one are classics. I like the grim reaper, his atitude during the movie, and the fact the he is the comic relief (okay so most of the movie is comic relief) Even if they are fun to watch to laugh at, it is worth it to watch	1
I followed Texhnolyze through it's fansubs, waited patiently for each DVD to come out.You don't have to sit and ponder, look hard and deep to find a meaning in Texhnolyze.  It hits you right in the face from the beginning.There are some people out there that society likes to forget.  Likes to shove to the backburners and ignore.  In this tale, they are a whole race of people - the people of the underground city of Lux.And even within them, sides are chosen.  You're either in or your out.  Ichise is one of these outcasts and he lives by what he knows.  The only thing he knows - his strength, his brute force.This point is particularly brought out in one of the last episodes, when Ichise makes the decision to protect Ran.  He's come to feel something for the girl and, perhaps, in a way she reminds him of the mother he could never save.  So he goes to offer the only thing he's sure of having - his body.  That's always been his bargaining chip, always been what everyone wanted.Anger, rage and fighting.  Though are all Ichise knows.  How do you expect him to act any less animalistic than the animal this society made him become?  It's clear through most of the show that he doesn't know how to react to people.Likewise, it's the same old sort of theme out of many a popular sci-fi movie - man bringing about an end to his own world.  Ichise inadvertantly is thrust into all of this by his texhnolyze, Ran is thrust by her visions and everyone else by some intricate connection.  But eventually, Lux collapses because of technology, the classic warning given in so many Apocalypse movies.Not each episode requires such in-depth searches for meaning.  It all fits into the grandier scheme and message of the series itself.  This series, as a whole, is a very good series.  It does require connecting together pieces and keeping larger themes in mind, as well as a little psychology but what good series /doesn't/	1
"    I really did give this a chance but I can't say I like the show. It focuses more on the ""police"" aspect and less on the science, which differentiates the CSI series from most of the other garbage out there. I know David Caruso has his fans but I just can't appreciate him in this vehicle...  "	0
  From a serious U2 fan's perspective, the best thing about this dvd is simply the selection of songs.  The bonus material is cool, the sound quality's great, the visuals are always impressive, but it's the SONGS that are the real attraction.  As it should be.  Two scorching rockers from their criminally ignored debut album BOY, four in a row from the all-time masterpiece ACHTUNG BABY, and nearly everything from their Grammy-sweeping triumph HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB.  I also love that they chose to not play anything from their string of disappointing nineties albums.  Good call! Also, Many familiar songs are given exciting new treatments, such as Running To Stand Still (a perfect hybrid of the Joshua Tree and Zoo TV versions), Elevation (longer, better build-up), Bullet The Blue Sky (check out Edge's extended blues jam in the final minutes), and Original of the Species (acoustic piano ballad).  This was the first major U2 tour in which they routinely and substantially altered the set list.  For instance, when I saw them they played Miss Sarajevo, Stuck In A Moment, Gloria, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, Instant Karma, Until The End Of The World, and others not represented here.  Here's hoping they release at least one more Vertigo Tour DVD...	1
"I am a huge U2 fan and this is the BEST concert I have ever seen.  This concert is simply unbeliveable.  It proves to all those stupid people that the belief that U2 were only good in the 80s and 90s is a load of garbage.  U2's still got it.  This concert proves it.  If you don't think U2's good anymore, go watch this concert.  All that You Can't Leave Behind is a good album.  Maybe not as good as Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby but it is still good.  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb left a little to be desired.  And for the stupid guy at the beginning of these reviews (I think it was the first one) what do you mean Bono was supporting homosexuality???????????  When he kissed Edge, it was representing the betrayal of Jesus Christ.  Look up the lyrics to the song that they were singing,  ""Until the End of the World.""  ""I took the money... I kissed your lips (face in the concert) and broke your heart.""  Bono represents Judas Iscariot in the song.  Also, if you still don't believe me and think this is some love song or something, watch any U2 concert with this song- almost all of them show Bono doing a little devil-horn thing, usually after kissing Edge (Christ) The only thing I agree with in that guy's review is that Edge really is the spirit of the band, not Bono.  I love the delay that Edge uses in his guitar.  And I hate how when people think of U2 they think of Bono.  Bono's fine but I love how Edge plays.  Anyway, go read his review if you want to find out more.  Just don't listen to that homosexuality crap.  Anyway, this concert is awesome and I could just watch it over and over again.  In fact, I'm actually watching it tonight!  Great show- makes you feel like you're actually there.  U2 is a wonderful band with good Christian messages in their songs and I can't wait for their next album and concert to come out"	1
I suggest watching the original version: Sword of Doom - which is amazing. A lot less acid is involved, and less cliche. Izo is a rent, at best	0
"Asks the interviewer, ""What place would you give Shoot the Piano Player in relation to your other films?"" Answers director Franois Truffaut, ""No place. Simply the second film I made."" Considering his first feature film was The Four Hundred Blows and his third was Jules et Jim, Truffaut's matter-of-factness and lack of pretense is worth a smile. Shoot the Piano Player is worth smiles, too. It's a clever film, playful at times, even funny. More than anything, however, it defies categorization. The movie is a strange and successful amalgamation of crime and comedy, suspense and inevitability, tragedy and love, and gangsters, girl friends and violence. It's the story of Charlie Koller (Charles Aznavour), a piano player in a Paris dive, who used to be Eduoard Saroyan, a famous pianist, whose wife committed suicide. Truffaut says the movie is a film about a shy man. Charlie is the kind of shy man who cannot bring himself to touch the hand of a woman he wants. He can't go back and open the door to the room where he left his wife sobbing. He thinks about what he should do, but can't do it, and then circumstances take over. Charlie, thanks to his brothers, finds himself in a gangland underworld where double-crossing is going to lead to a shootout in the snow. Some say Shoot the Piano Player is an homage to American gangster films. Perhaps it is, but I challenge anyone to spend much time considering this possibility while watching the movie. The film is original, funny, moving and sad. It's the kind of film that people who love movies write essays about. All I know is that I was moved by Charlie. We leave him where we met him, playing piano in a Paris dive.Charles Aznavour, a diminutive man with a hangdog look, plays Charlie perfectly. Aznavour is probably better known in the U. S. as a singer, but in France he's seen as both an actor and a singer. He's a minimalist, he says about himself. Charlie thinks too much and does too little. Aznavour lets us see into Charlie's soul with few words. It's a marvelous performance that left me saddened by Charlie, but liking him.The Criterion DVD transfer is first-rate. Criterion gives us two discs. The first has the movie and a commentary track. The second disc contains interviews by Aznavour and Marie Dubois, who played Charlie's girlfriend, Lena, plus excerpts from documentaries featuring Truffaut, and other extras. The Criterion case contains a 28 page booklet with substantial material on the film and Truffaut"	1
Somehow - this movie touched my heart and my mind - and I am sure if Ben and Matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime.  However - it just may be one ofthose once in a lifetime things - like first love - impossibleto re-capture, and in a sense, haunting.  I am not obsessive inany way but I have watched this movie at least twenty times -with each time revealing another layer of meaning - and with the movie becoming a place where I sometimes go for comfort.  The synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles - maybe their best ever - in combination with simply agreat story most definitely puts this movie in a specialcategory - so buy it and watch it.  You'll be glad you did.Mik	1
THE  QUALITY WAS GOOD AND THE STORIES WERE ALSO GOOD. I AM ON THE LIST WHEN THE FIRST SEASON COMES OUT. THIS IS LIKE A TEASE	1
This version, bears very little resemblance to the book with a confusing story, but at same time seems to expect that you have read the book to fill in the gaps of its story. The book was a simple good story, why did they abandon it  and the characters so completely?The sets and costumes are great, but can the makers of such a bad film be trusted to have made them authenic for the period?I have only watched the first disc, but it be a while before I will be able to force myself to watch the others.	0
What can a single lie do?  That is the question that is examined in Lillian Hellman's The Children's Hour.Martha (Shirley Maclaine) and Karen (Audrey Hepburn) run a small boarding school in a small New England town.  Karen is engaged to a local doctor (James Garner).  When Karen punishes a malicious student, the little girl decides to get revenge.  The way the girl does this is repeat a out of context statement made by Martha's aunt (Miriam Hopkins).  To complicate matters, she blackmails another girl (Veronica Cartwright) into confirming the story.This lie immediately destroys the Martha and Karen's school.  But their life's are destroyed soon thereafter when their slander suit is rejected.  But when the lie exposed it is too little too late.When the play opened in the late 50's it was daring and very controversial.  When the film opened in 1961, it was still controversial.  But 40 years later, it is not the lesbian story line that is interesting but how little has changed.Hepburn gives her usual excellent performance and would have gotten an Oscar nomination if she hadn't made Breakfast at Tiffany's that year.  Shirley Maclaine was fresh off her success in The Apartment and was ready to stretch her dramatic legs.  She proved that she could handle drama just as well as comedy.  But it would be 15 years for her to get another great dramatic role (The Turning Point).Fay Bainter and Miriam Hopkins were major character actors in the 30's and 40's and were given one final chance to show what they had left.  Bainter received an Oscar nomination for this film.William Wyler had nothing to prove in the 60's yet he continued to select great films with bite that featured women in strong roles.  This was another triumph for him.DVD EXTRAS: NONE	1
Not a good copy of this great movie. I'd wait and buy the &quot;Restored Authorized Edition.&quot; Even though I bought this version, I've ordered the other. That's how much I like Metropolis is general	0
This is the only movie that I really like, made by woody allen,but is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.	1
I was so excited when this DVD came out hoping to get the four Pittsburgh Steelers highlight films from the '70s.  98% of all this material is already included in the Super Bowl Collection Sets put out last year on DVD.  Why won't NFL Films step up and give us more??? This should be a STEELER-SPECIFIC box set, not some rehash of the entire season for all teams...Come On Steve Sabol; give us what we want!!	0
"Back in the 1980s, back before every television show was ""CSI: City Of Your Choice"" and ""Law & Order: Crime Division of Your Choice,"" there was a veritable plethora of well-written, clever, hour-long mystery programmes - ""Magnum P.I.,"" ""Murder, She Wrote,"" ""Moonlighting,"" ""Hart to Hart,"" ""The A-Team,"" to name just a few.  And this was when most people still only had three commercial networks to choose from (not counting PBS).  But far and away, the best of these mystery shows (and perhaps the most under-rated) was ""Remington Steele,"" in which Pierce Brosnan (with second billing!) and Stephanie Zimbalist fought crime with style, dash, wit, comedy, and a bit of romance.  The series, with its rat-a-tat dialogue, vaguely Deco feel (a slight Deco revival was the only good thing about `80s d�cor), and occasional zaniness, at times harkens back to the wonderful Preston Sturges-esque screwball comedies of the 1930s and `40s.  Indeed, it's clear from the moment that Brosnan appears on the screen in episode one of season one that not only did he have the star power of Classic Hollywood, but he was a Cary Grant for our times; devastatingly handsome in dapper Saville Row suits with an accent as charming and distinctive as Grant's.  (As an aside, it's also clear that Brosnan was born to play James Bond - truly, who was surprised that he was bestowed with the honor, albeit belatedly?  We won't get into the infamous Season Five vs. Bond debacle.) In the entertainment field, there are actors-with-a-lowercase-""a"" (pretty much everyone falls into this category nowadays), Actors-with-a-capital-""A"" (truly impressive sorts, such as Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, and Anthony Hopkins), and then there are Stars.  Brosnan is clearly the lattermost, bright and luminous.  Zimbalist, as sleuth Laura Holt, is spunky, and makes a valiant attempt to be Rosalind Russell to Brosnan's Grant, but, somehow, she falls slightly flat.  Nevertheless, there's no denying the chemistry between the two, which is what really ""makes"" the show.  (This is particularly remarkable considering that the two notoriously didn't get along whilst filming the series.)References to Classic Hollywood are constant, and amusing - Remington Steele, the (sort of) reformed con-man-with-a-heart-of-gold has an encyclopedic knowledge of film, and often inadvertently stumbles across the solution to the weekly puzzle by drawing a comparison to a classic film.  (""Joseph Cotton, Orson Wells, `The Third Man,' British Lion Film Corporation, 1949."" is a particular favorite throughout the run of the series, as are Cary Grant films and, ironically, the occasional Bond reference.)  The show was scored by the wonderful Henry Mancini, he of ""Charade"" (A Grant reference, yet again!), ""The Pink Panther,"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" fame (among many others), which of course, adds to the caper/romantic feel of the show.  (By the way, I'll take the somewhat chaste clinches of Remington and Laura over the sordidness of ""Sex and the City"" to daydream about any day of the week!)I'm so pleased that Remington Steele has been released on DVD.  I was seven years old when it debuted, and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time (I was a sophisticated child).  But I hadn't seen it since, and once again, have found myself charmed by each and every episode.  For those who are too young to remember the series, check it out - it's much more worthwhile than anything on the air now, and for those of you who *do* remember it, revisit.  It's worth your time and money."	1
...but the movie was just plain stupid. Don't waste your time	0
In response to the earlier reviewer, this is Sergio Garrone's Django il Bastardo, not the other film the reviewer mentioned. Django il Bastardo is a small gem among Spaghetti Westerns, a low budget B movie in which a ghost (Django) avenges his own death (a topic later adapted by Clint Eastwood for his &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot;). Hence, Steffen's &quot;wooden&quot; acting is totally appropriate for the role. A little jewel with nice gothic atmosphere, innovative camera tricks and good supporting actors (a standout is Luciano Rossi as the main baddie's insane brother)	1
Great movie!Delivery of the order came in good time.This 2-Disc Collector's Edition comes with some interesting extras.  I found the offtakes/blubbers to be in bad taste, but the rest of the extras were worth seeing.Personnally I would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie.  Although it is interesting to watch, especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business, I find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself.  Just my personal preference.  No doubt others will have different opinions	1
The first was one of the best thrillers ever, with clever suspence, good characters, decent acting and awesome effects.This one is... meh. Why must you make a sequel to a huge success hit and turn the franchise into a straight-to-video series? What's the bloody point?Now there are some good parts. The rooms are pretty nice and the musice score is decent, but you know, that doesn't even save it. This movie is a annoying, pointless and downright piece of crap that only kids can easily love. It is so un-intelligent it really makes you wanna puke.The characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs. I don't even know them well. All they do is scream, run around in the Cube rooms and cannot keep their mouths shut.I also really hate the effects in this one as well. They felt like they were over-used. There is even a scene where a guy gets cut into peices and look how badly done it was.The direction is ok, but when it comes to adding wierdness, it's too much. I don't understand the story, there's a strange sex-scene which a Cube movie does not need. Cube is about suspence. This one is just about adding too much effects, a four-dimensional Cube and trying to make itself look better than the first one. You don't need that stuff. If you wanted to make a sequel better than the first, add something original, don't take itself too seriously and make sure it stays true to the original. But no, you just had to add all this unoiriginal time crap and have alot of special effects taking over and even a sex scene which is not cool because if it's a Cube movie, you don't need nudity.Overall, if you wanna kill off some time by watching this crap, go ahead. I know you like watching people getting killed in unoriginal ways and watching sex scenes. If you're a fan of Cube, dont' bother.Acting: 3/10Ugh, don't get me started. These actors have bad acting skills and I hope they die.Gore Factor: 4/10CGI gore?! Come on!?T&A: 1/10A Cube movie doesn't need nudity and they don't know that because they don't know Cube.Direction: 7/10Andrzej Sekula did have some visual eye in some parts. I did enjoy a few scenes and I dug the rooms, but you know, I can't say he's a great director. He turned the franchise with straight-to-video written all over it.Bottom Line: If you wanna watch, go ahead, then you'll be sorry.This movie is just sad. It doesn't try anything to impress you because it's idiotic. Lets hope Andrzej Sekula learned his lesson and should never do a sequel to an impressive indipendent film again	0
"Mathau and Lemon are very funny and no wonder they continued to make other movies together like ""Grumpy Old Men."" The plot line is straighforward but their acting and character sketch makes it truly entertaining and captures their classic relationship."	1
while not one of his best novels, tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time! jimmy smits does his best,but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble!! SKIP IT!!!!	0
The sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good.  I bought this primarily to see Jaco.  The biggest distraction was the bits of James Dean and Doo Wap music videos from the 50's added in.  I wish this was remastered with just the concert performances.  Also, it appears to me that the Jaco Bass solo was cut.  I still give it 5 stars regardless. 	1
Very entertaining movie. I enjoyed everything about this movie--- the acting, the humor, the singing and storyline!Also being from San Diego originally, it was nice to see famous hotel and landmark, The Hotel Del Coronado, being used in this movie as the hotel in which the all girls band performed and stayed! No the hotel wasn't The Seminole Ritz in Florida!	1
"I don't often watch foreign films.  The reason being, as an American, I don't feel that I can ever fully grasp the cultural and linguistic subtleties needed to truly understand and enjoy these works.  French....  Spanish....  German...  etc.... regardless of nationality, genre, or time period, they generally leave me cold.   With that in mind, I went into this with no doubts as to the film's greatness, but again, didn't think as an American I would be able to see it, as the situational nuances would be lost on me.   As it turned out, I was wrong, and found a sublime masterpiece that went down easily, and didn't seem obtuse or ""foreign"".   The experience could best be likened to watching ""The Graduate"", as you find yourself viewing seemingly mundane events and conversations, but the subtle turns in those events and words speak of such depth and gravity that you feel almost driven to your knees by the masterwork that you are watching. I won't recap the storyline, or discuss details of the movie itself, I just wanted to say that I went into this skeptical, expecting to find a picture that I couldn't relate to, but what I found was an immediate, compelling and moving work that speaks volumes of the human condition."	1
The movie had potential: good cast and interesting plot.  Its the kind of movie you want to like, but just can't.  I did not find it all that funny or romanic.  It seemed that the mother and a bride's maid were suppose to be funny characters but I found neither very amusing.  I have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other; this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie.  Their relationship is not developed well at all.  As another reviewer noticed, there is a bit of Pretty Woman here, as Dermot plays a male escort.  For whatever reason, Julia Roberts as a hooker is cute, whereas Dermot is not.  I found is pretty disgusting that Messing falls for a male prostitute.  There is a lot of crude sexual humor that I didn't care for.  My favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the English countryside, which is really beautiful.  Its not a terrible movie, but I would be upset if I paid $10 to see it in the theater	0
"As both a big fan of this movie and a film student, I feel that critics have been quick to judge this film as bad trash. This film has a sexy edge to it, that many other films in the ""teen film"" genre dare to exhibit. New Best Friend fullfills a fantasy for those girls who secretly desire to live dangerously and party every night, without it actually becoming a reality. The house is every girl's dream, and these girls are alluring and suavely tempting. The acting is far from terrible, and it was great to see Meredith Monroe  in a more sophisticated and darker role than her role as Andie in Dawson's Creek. Dominique Swain once again puts in an A+ effort for her role as the cheeky deviant Sydney. For anyone who loved films like Tart and Cruel intentions,this is the film for you. "	1
"...if the writers intended to have a reset-style ending all along, or if they were forced to compress and compromise their original vision.  Would be very interested to hear about the ""original"" ending envisioned (and I don't mean that of ep 26) by the writers...Nonetheless, after viewing the rest of WR, one can't avoid watching these last 4 eps.."	1
"It's an interesting approach at what people will do for money. Still, I hated it. John Travolta was terrible [as usual]. Lisa Kudrow, who was the reason I watched this, was so incredibly unlike her role on ""Friends"" as she was a murderous goldigging nympho-biatch who made you mad every time she was on screen. I was very disappointed with her performance. I can't believe this hilarious comedic actress went for such a ... part. The other supporting actors were no good either with the exception of Bill Pullman, who was pretty funny as the ""I could give a damn about it"" cop. The best thing about this movie though, is the cute, gullible waitress named Wendy who's only on screen about five minutes throughout the entire film. Anyway, skip this one. It was just plain awful"	0
"In this sixth (but not final) installment of the movie series, what we get is little story and too much senseless action (with a sprinkling of hot tub sex).  This is a very disappointing film.  Although it is the last such LWnC movie from this creative team, it does not end the storyline (with 28 volumes in the manga series, we probably would have needed another 3-7 films).  So the patient, constant viewer gets instead a hack-and-slash film of mid-caliber.The ending -- an over-extending action sequence set on a snowy slope -- is very unsatisfying; so are the characters:  unlike other LWnC films, we do not get to meet any new incidental characters.  As a result, the film is less about ""Edo"" soceity (which one cannot argue is the secondary if not primary goal of the manga team) and instead just a big showdown waiting to happen...waiting, waiting to happen.  The film is way too long and its pacing is horrible.I think the fault with the film lies in these two things:1) the writers/filmmakers chose poor source material.  The ""five wheel"" assassin team denies Itto and son the chance to mingle with regular Edo joes.  As a result, you do not get as I argued the best part of the series:  the rich detail of Edo life.2) the filmmakers must have been overwhelmed with James Bond films like ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and whatnot with their decision to make this movie ""samurai on skis"".  After the first few minutes of fighting on the snow, I was thinking ""Enough already, I get it:  samurai can be badass even on slippery surfaces!""Watch the first five and forever skip this sixth installment"	0
Any Sam Kinison fan needs to own this DVD or video.  You get 2 of Sam's HBO specials plus many special stand up features and Sam's home movies.  The only reason I did not give this box set a 5 star rating is the fact that in the first special feature called: rare stand up(I love the special features on DVDs), Sam told many jokes that were already on the HBO special.  Other than that, Sam's comedy is unlike anything you will see today.  He will really be thought of as a comedy legend.  These DVD's will crack you up.  I would recomend buying the Sam Kinison CDs, Live From Hell, and Have you seen me lately?  The Cd's(just listen to them in your car or at home) will give you the complementary material you need(plus the HBO specials) to truely love Sam Kinison.  He is one of the best, and you will be satisfied with with any purchase.  Just buy 1 CD or DVD and you will be hooked	1
The only reason I gave this movie a star was because there is no Zero star option. Where does Seagal continue to get backing for his movies - the last 8 (or 10?) have all been awful. His last good release was Under Seige. I only wish my 401K grew as fast as his waistline. Submeged is bad - no suprise there, it will be the last movie of his I watch, I just can't take it any more. Submerged? Must be a reference to his movie career which went under about a decade ago	0
Eric Maibus and Scott Bairstow have become fine young actors, and even their adequate performances cannot save this dismal, pointless, lurid and sadistic movie.  Dee Wallace Stone should be ashamed for participating.  Maibus plays the hypnotic leader of a teenage devil cult, with no conscience, morals, or regard for anyone but himself; Bairstow plays the usual &quot;misunderstood&quot; teen who looks to the group for acceptance.  The script is laden with offensive four letter words in every other sentence; enough is enough.  If this is the way teens talk, then steer me clear, folks.  There is no heart or soul in this movie, and no reason to rent or buy.  NO STARS.  C'MON AMAZON, WHEN YOU GONNA GIVE US THE 0 STARS OPTIONS??	0
 i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it. i heard that it was the most violent film ever made. i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better. i was dead wrong. cannibal ferox is a boring, unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation. im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys. the few gore scenes are pretty effective, but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws. if it was for giovanni lombardo radice[one of my favorite italian horror actors] starring in it, cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star.	0
"Although Tomorrow is Yesterday is an okay episode, it is not one to rave about.It is certainly not one of the original series' best. However, Return of the Archons is one of the best and one of my favourites.Kirk, Spock and McCoy investigate a planet where the inhabitants appear to be in a drug-induced state then rapidly change from walking peacefully and amiably along the streets into violent and looting maniacs that seem to lose all inhibitions. A mob attacks Kirk and crew and they are forced to defend themselves with their phasers. It seems the planet is run by a man named Landru, who advocates peace and tranquility to the extent that you get ""absorbed"".A kind of brainwash conditioning into thinking only of harmony and serenity.Later it is discovered that Landru is a computor projection;the edict of Landru who died 5,000 years ago has been continued by a computer I just read a review saying the solution to the Landru mystery won't surprise anyone, it sure surprised me. I didn't see that one coming"	1
I saw the original about 4-5 times from 1970-1971.. This one is not much different, just modestly.. I had been attempting to purchase this flick for 30 years, but was unable because the Studio (Warner Bros.) refused to release it under any format.. I was thrilled that it was finally released, and have since been watching it with many friends.. Most had no idea this movie was ever out.. I was particularly interested in Anita Palenburg, she has really changed over the last 38 years.. The content may be a bit provacative for most (Sex and Violence) but the quality are extraodinary for that era.. This one is a must for anyone.	1
I watched this on Masterpiece Theater and was intrigued enough with the family story to buy the book.  The characters and the historical context are much better developed in the book and you don't have to listen to that extraordinarily whiny, droning music. 	0
"By winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of New Englanders wins its first World Series in 86 years.It's true, the Patriots somehow pieced together a team that, despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as Super Bowl champions with a 17-2 record (which just as easily could have/should have been 18-1)...but the 2004 Boston Red Sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the American Sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 Patriots season just doesn't seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003.  Part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities (2001 having 9/11, the coming-of-age of Tom Brady, the Snow Bowl, and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting Super Bowl ever.  2003 had the release of Lawyer Milloy, the early stumbles to Buffalo and Washington, the birth of the winning streak, winter weather in Foxboro, and yet another thrilling Super Bowl finish); 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison, like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the ""W"" on the Patriots' side of the field.This is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling...the injuries (leading to the incredible ""throwback"" two-way play of veteran Wide Receiver/rookie Cornerback Troy Brown), the continued winning streak, the rebirth of offseason acquisition Corey Dillon, the continuing mastery of the Indianapolis Colts, and the return to Pittsburgh (where the record 21-game winning streak came to an emphatic end on Halloween (just days after the Red Sox won the World Series, karmically enough), where University of Michigan graduate Tom Brady resurrected himself from a triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the NFL to send the Patriots back to the Super Bowl, this time in the unfairly maligned city of Jacksonville, FL.No nail-biting endings this time, though...despite the best efforts of Terrell Owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else (with the possible exception of Curt Schilling, of course), the Eagles All-Pro was clearly the second-best receiver on the field as Deion Branch won the Super Bowl MVP for a record day (Safetyman and Render Of Mayhem Extraordinaire Rodney Harrison would have been my pick, actually) and the Patriots, though trailing early, never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the Eagles more than they deserved.Far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2 and another Super Bowl ring should be considered hum-drum, but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that, impressive as it was, just doesn't translate to the memorable re-telling that the Pats' previous title years do.  This is a great DVD for Pats fans, indispensible even, but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good NFL season can bring, I would recommend either of the previous Patriots highlights DVD's over this one"	1
Zakk pushed his voice beyond its limits on Mafia, and on this tour.  Its really hard to take, and I'm glad he returned to his regular smokey voice on Shot To Hell.BLS are a great group, but Zakk's persistent use of this higher strained vocal technique scuttles Blessed Hellride songs that were sung in regular pitch on the CDs.  Stoned and Drunk and Funeral Bell are critically altered to the point where I had to skip them.I'm actually starting to suspect that Zakk was using a vocal harmonizer tuned up an octave to achieve this effect, because I can't imagine how his vocal chords could withstand a tour sung this way.A few tunes sung this way I can handle, buts its total overkill on this DVD.The behind the scenes extras are enjoyable because Zakk is a funny guy	0
I don't usually like these type of movies, but this is a can't miss...you'll laugh	1
War exposed some violence simmering within one Gulf War veteran.  Christian Bale is electrifying as Jim, a tough-minded ex-Ranger whose brutal nature didn't subside after his return home to LA.They say war changes a man.  This might be evident here, but it feels more like the fighting only unleashed the demons inside of Jim.  Along with his buddy Mike(Freddy Rodriguez), the two tear through the town, bingeing on drugs and alcohol. Their is no deep plot here, just a couple of ruffians going around town looking for jobs.  But it is a great character study, watching Jim self-destruct.  Bale is great in this type of role, like he was in American Psycho or The Machinist.  I liked this movie much more than Training Day, which this director previously wrote the screenplay for	1
"I have tried for years & years to get it. I still don't! This being the one Bergman film I seem never to get around to seeing, I made sure I saw it this time @ a Bergman retrospective @ my local art house theatre. Well @ least I sat thru it. During the show, no less than 5 people got up & just walked out. So I guess it's not just me! I personally found it to be mediocre at best. I don't get why folks think this is such an incredible film? The storyline is just so banal, as are the continuous close-ups of faces centered mid-screen. DATED TO SAY THE LEAST! I don't think it holds up-period! I have said it before & I still believe that if you want to see what Bergman was attempting thru-out his career, GO SEE ""INTERIORS"" BY WOODY ALLEN! He does Bergman BETTER THAN Bergman! And don't even get me started on Liv Ulman---ugh!!!!!"	0
I was a bit disappointed in this tape.  The workouts are too easy.  I had mastered Abs of Steel I and was looking for Abs of Steel 2.  I couldn't find it so I bought this one but its too easy.  I found a used Abs of Steel 2 and I like it much better	0

"This version ""Wind and Cloud - The Storm Riders"" made in 2004 is not the same as ""The Storm Riders"" made in 1998.This dvd is a condensed version of a TV series packaged by Tai Seng. It is full-screen and was made for TV. It is pretty disjointed as it was condensed into 2 hours from 30 hours.Most people doing the reviews for this DVD is confusing everyone writing positive reviews for the 1998 film staring Aaron Kwok and Ekin Chen"	0
"I enjoyed watching queen Latifah in a more mature acting. But the picture quality of the DVD that i bought was terrible (Thanx to amazon). To my surprise all the trailers quality were superb but the movie was Terrible terrible and terrible. To be honest the quality of the picture spoilt the fun side of the movie but still I say big ups to Queen(Uyisikhokho ntombazana). I had to use this platform although its of irrelevancy to comment about the movie format. ""Enjoy everyday like its your last"	1
This is a beautifully orchestrated tale about the delightful absurdity in all human endeavor. It is also a story of cross-cultural misunderstanding of the highest order.  Kinsky was a madman in the film and in real life and therefore perfect for the part.  The scene of the steam ship spinning out of control in that waterfall is one of the memorable in the history of the cinema. The cinematography and editing are a masterpiece. Unforgettable	1
"The Cutting Edge is one of those break out feel good movies you can watch anytime and it's still as much fun today as the first time I saw it in 1992. ""Doug Dorsey"" played with verve by D.B. Sweeney, is a rising hockey star with a bright future ahead him until a freak accident on the ice shatters his chances of playing at the peak of the competitive level. It's not long before Doug is noticed by skating coach ""Anton Pamchenko"" Roy Dotrice, an affable personality whom the audience gravitates to from the start. Pamchenko brings Mr.Dorsey to the estate of Kate Moseley, Moira Kelly, a would-have been gold medalist at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo. She blamed her former partner for their loss and never fully recovered, you see. Kate has an acerbic tongue that's as sharp as her blades. She has issues welcoming a new partner and Doug is no exeception. The two meet and a hostile alliance is soon formed as they begin practice sessions. Doug isn't used to figure skates and Kate takes full advantage of this by ""missing"" serveral connections in the routines which cause him to painfully contact the ice. Each time he falls, Kate skates by teasing him uttering ""Toe pick."" One of my favorite scenes in the movie. Doug is made of quite stern stuff and  soon turns the tables on Kate in a harmless way during an impromtu ""hockey game"" played on her private indoor rink. Having ironed out the roughness, the two become quite polished and a budding romance ensues between them. The question is, do they have what it takes to become 1988 Olympic Champions in pairs figure skating?The acting is charming and the soundtrack first rate.I would have given it five stars except for the ending, which I won't give away here.Buy the DVD & CD, you won't be dissappointed"	1
Some of the other reviews have said that the film is not editted properly and 'too slow'. I'm not a film-maker and cannot comment on that other than to say that they are wrong. The film is amazing. I'm not sure if there is ANY other movie or documentary that shows what a serialkiller-cum-dictator-cum-statesman is like. Nowadays people might not know who Idi Amin is, or what he did, so its important to read up a little so you can truely appreciate this movie. He plays accordian? You see him meeting with his 'advisors' (some of whom disappear so after.) You see him play acting like a grown-up boy with toy soldiers. You see his self-appointed royal pedigree and send his support for Nixon! Its fascinating and amazing. This is man that, self-proclaimed, actually ATE some of his rivals (not the whole body I hope). He killed many people directly and by his policies. His ego is outstanding and its an amazing movie. Apparently, there is a new movies coming out about Idi Amin starring Forrest Whitaker. He's a good actor and so I look forward to seeing it. But this is the REAL guy. Its amazing and a feat probably never to happen again	1
I have never understood why people find this to be the pinnacle of British Comedy. Once you get past the numerous jokes about Mrs. Slocum's.... cat and a flaming Mr. Humphreys you have very little left to justify it's long run except that it was probably the right show in the right place at the right time. In retrospect it is lacking. Many will disagree with me but that's life	0

"I read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards.  A few of the characters were switched around, but I was so impressed with the adaptation. A thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy - the kids in the kitchen scene and when Mr. Arnold's arm drops on Ellie's shoulder as she's trying to turn the generator back on, for example. There have been countless lines I've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times, due to my obsession.And after watching it more than 25 times, I've come to appreciate it more. Great cast - Sam Neil is my favorite. Richard Attenborough is a little too cute and nice, but I liked his white clothing, the hat, and the amber cane. Wayne Knight was incredible as Nedry, the slob. He's as likeable as ever, though somewhat the villain. I always hate it when he dies. Jeff Goldblum fit the description of Ian Malcom from Crichton's novel well. Crichton sparked my interest in Chaos Theory, sometimes called The Butterfly Effect. I am a firm believer in it. And of course, in the novel and film, Malcolm was right. ""Life finds a way...""  (In Chaos Theory, the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions, and ""random"" --unpredictable-- events result from the ""normal"" equation/setup, because there is never a fixed set of outcomes; the system is unpredictable because of its complexity. Hammond thought his system was without error, that he was in complete control. He believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female, but he was wrong - the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian DNA that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA. This DNA gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce, ""survive,"" in a single-sex environment. And it turned out that Hammond was wrong about many other equations - things are not as black and white as he thought, and it is problematic to predict long-term behavior of his animals.)Love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet.We watched the Mr. DNA segment in a high school biology class. I've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated (though I found Mr. Hammond's live speaking lines to be unrealistic...was he really planning to be there for each tour?).The kids were kind of annoying. I didn't notice this until I was a little older, but Lex (""I prefer to be called a hacker"") uses Silicon Graphics' 3D file system navigator to turn power back on in the park. Their logo is on the monitor. If only UNIX were as popular as Windows is now...Anyway, the soundtrack was classic - it was the first CD I bought, back in the mid-90s.  Tonya Harding skated to the theme at the 1994 Olympics, or some other competition. I only liked her because of her excellent music choice"	1
Everything is this movie seems out of place. The old cliche &quot;good cop-bad cop&quot;, lived by Sutherland and his pal doesn't work at all!  Dridget is in an awkward performance, totally unconvincing, unreal, flat.  ANyway, it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a  tremendous waste of time.	0
"I'm not sure if the drills in this video are really championship calibre.  However, most of the drills that I used with my team were effective.  This video is for the first or second year Junior High coach (like myself) or any coach on the recreational level (ie. CYO and/or PAL coach or just in your driveway with your son or daughter).  They are not too difficult to follow and supplementary drills can be created easily enough. The narrator uses the expression ""dual purpose"" drills which translates into getting more than one benefit from any drill.  Combining shooting along with conditioning is used in most of the shooting drills.  For instance, a drill with 3 players, one shooter, one rebounder and one passer.  A simple drill but after the shooter shoots, he sprints to the wall and then back to his spot.  The timing is such that when he gets back to his spot, the passer is already passing the ball.  Thought this aspect of the drill was just staged for the video but when I tried it, it worked great!  Other drills also worked well like ""shots across the lane"" and a few of the rebounding drills.  The explanations were mostly of the drills themselves and not too much on the X's and 0's.  Added tips are given if you listen close enough and the foul shooting and regular shooting techniques are discussed in a clear concise manner which turned out to be my favorite part of the video.  The drills are forty five seconds to about a minute long.  The sample practices given at the end of the video will be extremely helpful to any recreational coach.  The video could have been more detailed with more theory (which I like), but in truth, it gives you just what it says.  Some very good drills along with a superior format for a sports instructional video make this a buy"	1
Great movie and it was a pleasure buying it through Amazon	1
My god. This was the most idiotic horror film since Blair Witch. All the character were utterly retarded. They had plenty of chances to escape and blew them all. Duh!!!!!! So the viewer just stops giving a crud when the victims are behaving like screeching buffoons. And the ending...made no sense WHATSOEVER!!! The Ben guy is tried for their deaths. Sure that makes sense. It's not as though they couldn't find the mine where the ACTUAL murderer was and get a crudload of DNA evidence and dead bodies. Not to mention the alleged hundreds of other tourists that have gone missing from that EXACT place. Total piece of junk. A wasted opportunity for all involve	0
"WOW.  That's the only thing I can say after reading all sorts of negative reviews.  I admit, the very first time I watched the Grudge with my father NEITHER of us thought the movie was scary at all and couldn't understand its success, but after watching the movie a second time two months later by myself late at night I REALLY began to see how frightening the movie is.  Probably contains the same amount of fear as the original Exorcist, another movie that's really effectively well done.  You HAVE to watch the Exorcist and the Grudge at night to get the proper effect.  The Grudge benefits greatly when it comes to maintaining a moody atmosphere and a pretty interesting story.  I say ""pretty interesting"" because the storyline isn't the best, or the easiest to understand.  Just interesting enough to get the job done.  The Grudge also benefits when it comes to not giving away too much or too little.  In fact, this is probably its strongest point.  Every time something scary happens, you see just a ""little bit"" of that scary monster boy or some kind of strange shadow effect, which is *very* important if you want to effectively scare someone.  If the scary boy had appeared on screen for longer than a few seconds it wouldn't have scared me nearly as much because I would have gotten used to seeing it.  The boy appears, and then he's gone.  Not giving away too much REALLY works with this movie.  You see, to really scare me you simply CAN'T put a scary monster on screen for long periods of time and you HAVE to create a moody atmosphere to make the film believable.  The Grudge works *extremely* well it this area.  The fact that something scary happens almost always unexpectedly in the Grudge allows me to give the film another compliment.  I'm telling you, the scene with the woman inside that building by herself (well, except for a security guard) and having to travel home to an apartment building all by herself is about 10 minutes of total bone-chilling excitement.  I *loved* this scene.  I was totally on the edge of my seat wondering when the woman was finally going to have something bad happen to her.  The scene where the woman saw darkness coming before walking down the stairs and having to hurry up to get out of there was *awesome*, and the scene a few moments after this happened where she DID see something in the shadow was ANOTHER awesome display of bone-chilling brilliance.  There's a bunch of scenes like this throughout the movie.  Freakin' AWESOME!  Excellent pacing and suspense makes the Grudge a true horror classic, in my opinion.  I've seen a thousand horror movies in my time and I'd easily put the Grudge right up there as one of the best.  People today have drastically different opinions when it comes to what makes a movie scary.  Remember the good old days when everyone could agree that the Exorcist was the scariest movie of all-time?  I wish everyone agreed that the Grudge is a total classic, and that the Ring is another excellent one. "	1
"""Cursed"" is the most pathetic werewolf movie I've seen since ""An American Werewolf in Paris"".  The acting is terrible, directing is poor (Shame on you Mr. Craven) and the storyline is largely uncompelling.  The werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience.  This movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is ""cool"", but if you're looking for a scary movie, don't look for ""Cursed"".  Well, at least it's not as bad as ""An American Werewolf in Paris"", but that sure as hell isn't saying much. "	0
"Crackerjack courtroom trial drama based on a true story of three Australian soldiers in the Boer War accused of killing prisoners and a Dutch minister. The British command is obviously using the three as scapegoats to convince the Germans, who seem eager to join the war on the side of the Boers, to stay out. The men claim they were only following orders, orders which went against ""normal"" military practice. This is a new type of warfare: the Boers fought as guerrillas, not in uniform, not by ""the rules."" The Australians on trial felt they were engaging them on those terms. The morality of war itself, therefore, is just as much on trial as these men. They all lose in the end. The trial scenes are well paced, and the use of flashback creates just the right amount of tension. Also there are enough shady gray areas to keep the proceedings interesting. Well worth a watch"	1
The thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel gives the most logical explanation for the inequality in development in the world today. Not based on one group of people being inherently smarter than other groups, but based on a group of people favored by their environment and other factors.....very interesting theory that should be given more study.	1
I have now seen several Gerry Anderson projects, many hits and some misses, this one is close to dead last for me (wait, it is dead last). A priest driving a model T is the hero in this one. He also has a shrinking ray (shrinks to like 1/3 normal) that he uses on his assistant who is a groundskeeper/secret agent. Sound interesting? Well, I got the set cheap so why not buy it? If your an Anderson fan as I am, it was worth the price, just don't expect to show it to your friends as it's really tame and slow plodding with model T car chases and not a whole lot of action. Here is my ranking of the shows I like from Gerry Anderson so take that into account of your own tastes. #1 UFO (a live adult sci-fi show with some great character development), #2 Joe 90(the concept is great and the non continuous storylines work good here), #3 Captain Scarlet (I love the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on terror to me), #4 Thunderbirds (had a Corgi toy as a kid, it was the best show for kids on TV at the time), #5 Stingray (for the time, it was a great action kids show), #6 Fireball XL5 (like a Stingray except in space and black and white), #7 The Protectors (eh, it's OK), #8 Space 1999 (this is where my recommended shows stop, this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really stupid even I couldn't stay with it in the 70's),#9 Terrahawks (just started watching it now it may move up above Space 1999 and the Protectors), #10 Secret Service. I haven't watched his other stuff and I know there is stuff out there like Supercar but that would probably rank above Secret Service for me.    	0
"Dont take me wrong I do love Mariah but this movie is not making any sense to me I mean Mariah doesnt seem very interest to ""play"" in this movie!!! This movie is all about music music music music music repeating over and over again nothing new nothing has been changed... come on!!! but then Mariah seem to be better in another movie called Wisegirls but again I honestly dont think that Mariah should be an actress herself I mean I think she is better off to be a singer instead of playing movies. Wisegirls she seem like she wanted to have the ""attention"" and ""show-off"" like saying in her mind: ""Look at me I am in the movie!"" I honestly deep in my heart she dont need to be playing in any movies unless she stands up and do her ""work"" with her actions in the movies not like this and Wisegirls movies. I feel bad for giving this movie a 1 star but I had to say what's my opinion about this movie anyways. Wisegirls was alittle better than this one!"	0
I enjoyed High Anxiety very much - I happen to be a fan of Mel Brooks and all his movies. It was entertaining and funny. I would suggest it to anyone	1
A movie to enjoy watching many times. Very entertaining and light.	1
Loved this movie when it first came out and loved it just as much the this time around.  Two of my favorite actors depicting a story that love has no boundaries.  Very funny and moving - yes, I'm a romantic! It's awesome!	1
When this show was on back in the day on Fox I couldnt believe I was actually watching something I could relate to. There doesnt seem to be really that many Tv shows that deal with dark and The Real Life experinces of Real People. If ya ask me when it was on. It was actually something that gave me some relief. I deal everyday with some experinces re-lated to the show. Its somewhat of a constant battle. Enough about me. Im really glad all 3 Seasons are out. And im also glad I didnt have to wait many years either. One thing I didnt like about Fox when Titus was on they kept moveing it around. It wasnt fair for the show. Then the next thing ya know there were some repeats then it was gone. Im not really happy with Fox cause Titus still should be on tv or had a much longer run then it did. I hope Chris shows up in something else soon. Hes got one of those faces ya never forget	1
having seen the most shocking of horror films that relish in the grotesque and stay in our minds like a stain on our brain and enjoyed them i began to watch this film with a sceptical eye. having watched 10 minutes of the film i ejected the dvd that it had been burned onto and smashed it convinced that if the devil does exist then he exists purely in this film. do not watch this film. it exploits everything that is wrong with humanity and leaves a taste in your mouth that you can never rid yourself of. the only positive thing that i have to say about this film is that after watching it and finding myself sicked and deeply disturbed i know that in one way or another that i must be a good person. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!	0
"Throughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor's music ""self-indulgent bullsh**"" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes' summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke's death. Reminds me of the Republisuck's ""Fair and Balanced"" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain't in a museum. Just ask the artists (most of whom are alive) whom Burns left out. Metheny, you out there"	0
Don't listen to anyone when they say this movie is bad, it's good. Elektra is filled with aciton, and FX and supervillians! Elektra is one of the best Marvel Movies! Go see it now	1
I watched this movie, not because I am into Ms. Milano, or her breasts, but because it was shot (sadly) at my high school--Shattuck-St. Mary's School in Faribault, MN. Doesn't say much for the school, or for the faculty who had bit parts in it.	0
I don't have a review, I have a question.  As a grandparent of a 10 year old blind girl.  Is it possible that someone could send me directions for  this game?  I would like to get it printed in braille for her.  Thanks for  your help..Judi Ree	1
"This is another superbly done documentary from the award winning PBS investigative journalism series Frontline (Peabody Award, Emmy and many more!). Disregard what one reviewer said about this being pro-Walmart propaganda paid for by the corporation. He's obviously  smoking something, because this is made and hosted by Hedrick Smith, a PULITZER prize winning journalist who used to write for the NY Times. He is one of America's most respected journalists. I started watching the show since I was in high school (I'm now late 20's) and their shows are exceptionally high quality. Now, if Frontline is interviewing people who lost jobs and showing Rubbermaid factory equipment being auctioned off because they got put out of business by Walmart, how is this pro-Walmart? The story starts in America and its impact on the US economy. He interviews some professors, economists, managers, suppliers, and executives. Then the story moves to China and HK, and then back to the US. There are some very clear insights from nmost of the people interviewed especially from one professor who talks about the shift in American culture and business history. Is Walmart good for America? I can't answer that and neither can Frontline. This documentary does an excellent job presenting facts without judgement and presents both sides and the complex shades in the middle. It asks some thought provoking questions. The US trade deficit is getting worse every day. Quality is going up (some ""Made in China"" stuff is now very good and getting exponentially better every year), and that's really scary for us in America. Who's the blame? Well, all of us. We're not competing well in the global economy, and we want the cheapest goods. We're not willing to put our money where our mouth is. If you're interested in economics, history, social issues, this is a must see. If you care about the American economy, and global events, you should watch this documentary. It's loads better than the ""Walmart, the High Cost of Low Prices"" film (which is very one sided and not nearly as well done). oh,.. and start learning Chinese"	1
The &quot;Latin&quot; moves in this workout seem strangely like American aerobics to me.  You can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves, but if you're interested in Latin dance, my advice is to buy Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac instead.  This workout just isn't as energetic and fast-paced as it looks	0
In this movie based on a true story we see Jerry Stahl played by Ben Stiller. Jerry is a geek Hollywood scriptwriter who turns out junk for sitcoms although he thinks he is Shakespeare by his admiration of his own writing. Jerry has it all- a Hollywood mansion, Liz Hurley, a cool car and yet he decides to throw it all away for some Heroin. Jerry's Heroin habit costs $6,000 a week but he is only earning $5000(!!!) per week. One does not need a Phd. in Advanced Mathematics to realize this this spells TROUBLE. Jerry eventually gets clean with the help of Maria Bello and then he wrote his story in a best selling book. One can only hope that his new fortune does not lure him back into the Drug Scene. I give this sorry excuse of a movie 5 stars because it has Maria Bello in it although I still can't figure out why she finds Jerry The Geek so interesting. His story is the same as any Street Junkie.They all look the same to me when they are injecting Heroin into their veins on the street	1
I was sooooooooo excited to see that this movie had been released, and I was not disappointed.  The dancing was magnificent, and it was amazing to see Patrick & Lisa together.I have to saythought for many....it was disheartening to see you perform with your wife, Patrick, because so many of us have fantasized of that same possibility!I would recommend it to ALL who love dance!  It is a beautiful tribute to what a person CAN do!	1
"After watching Spirited Away I was excited to watch other movies by the same director. Unfortunately every movie seems to be an excuse to preach his simplistic ""it's bad to hate"" message.What the creators of Princess Mononoke and others like them refuse to admit is that hate is a natural reaction and even healthy when directed towards the destructive, disgusting things of the world. Yes, hate can become overly consuming, just as any other emotion can overcome us, or we an hate the good things of the world making us the bad one's,(just as loving that which is evil wouldn't be a good thing)  but placed in its proper context at the proper time, at that which deserves hate helps us avoid dangers and deal with certain problems.And the people who claim that hate is all-evil themselves hate the ""haters"", which I find comical.   The movie also has strong pro feminist/anti man messages.    I wanted to like this film but I don't appreciate being duped into listening to people rant and rave about nonsense"	0
I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS GREAT!NOTHING LIKE THE GOSPEL TO ME!!DON'T COMPARE!BILLOAH IS SEXY BABY!HE PLAYED ZULU!! (PRETTY EYES)THE MOVIE WAS VERY FUNNY ALSO AND TAUGHT A LESSON IN LOVE!!!5 STAR MOVIE!!****	1
"I was so disappointed in this film. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul Terrance Howard put into his acting. I love Terrance, he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing. He did an excellent job with the acting but I would have much rather seen him portraying Marvin Gaye. Call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in Memphis, Tennessee in this day and time? And did Terrance Howard give Ludacris' character a cassette tape to listen to? Not a CD, a tape. I probably would have flushed it down the toilet too. And the hook to that song, ""You know it's hard out here for a pimp."" Ya think? With prostitution being illegal in the state of Tennessee and all. I found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because I was so embarrassed. Don't get me wrong, I love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just don't quite bring it, do we? ""The Cookout"" ""How High?"" ""Girl 6"" ""Woo"" ""Kingdom Come"" Now we can add ""Hustle and Flow"" to the list. I'm glad Terrance Howard redeemed himself in ""Crash."" Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."	0
"My two year old only child adores this DVD so much that she's ""adopted"" Max as an imaginary younger brother.  There's no flash and no dash, no special effects and no tired slapstick - but there is charm, gentleness, intelligence, humor, and completely accessible characters for the little people in your life.  My daughter views Max and Ruby as such a treat that I used it as a potty training reward - and she's always just as delighted with it as she was the first time she saw it. Ages 18 months through five. Five stars, and then some"	1
This DVD will bring tears to your eyes.  My father was a professional violist for over 40 years and got much pleasure from this video.  My mother enjoys watching this video at least once a week.  It will inspire any young violinst to play with more feeling and overall satisfaction.  Just seeing the old footage of the great masters of long ago is worth your purchase.  If you are a lover of music, you must have this in your collection.	1
Great to own such a John Candy/Dan Akroid classic.  Not recommended for children. Quite a lot of profanity	1
this movie is the worst movie I have ever seen!  Complete waste of my time	0
Highly acclaimed. That, I knew. I watched the first 30 minutes, which is 1/4 of the movie, before I decided to hang it up. New lady moves into a conservative French town and opens a chocolate shop. This upsets the local church, even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate. Okay. Can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot? Nope. This one's boring. 	0
I watched this film at the suggestions of a friend...Had to watch it again the very next night and have seen it several times since.  It's so nice to watch a film where people are acutally nice to each other and there is no offensive language or elicit scenes.Just recently learned of some friends in a very similar situation and recommended the film to them to help work throught the emotions they are having.  Livvy, a young and educated woman finds herself pregnant shortly following the death of her mother.  The father of her baby leaves the scene and Livvy's father insists that she will not have a child out of wedlock and so arranges her marriage to a lonely farmer in a very rural area of Colrado.  Ray (the farmer) is shy and reserved, but was brought up with high moral values and treats Livvy like she is something special.  The rest of the movie develops the story of how Ray and Livvy get acquainted and eventually fall in love, even though that was not Livvy's original intention. I think the film has a powerful message about forgiveness and forbearance.  I have purchased several copies and love to share it with friends.  I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!	1
"This is a teen movie with the endless teen theme of boy seeking to get the goodies from the girl. It is better than the average for this genre due to several factors. Mostly, it is because is well done.The subject matter lends itself to course treatment but that is not what is presented here. Instead, the situations are depicted with as much dignity as possible from hormone driven teenagers and is is presented with comedy.The time of the film is the 50s. Society was more innocent back then but boys still had the same thing on their minds that they always have and always will. In this case, the school geek has a bad case for the school beauty queen. He is aided in his quest by the cool loner from out of town who has his own heart set on ""the nice girl"". Meanwhile, the unpopular girl has a bad case herself for the geek. The geek achieves his goal and learns that the decorative aspects of women sometimes cover up the less desirable traits. The loner finds that the nice girl really is a nice girl and that love is something special. The unpopular girl undergoes a hormone miracle and becomes a prize catch. Everyone winds up happy except the town bully/rich boy. It is simplistic in its portrayal but no less appealing for that.Kelly Preston plays the beauty queen and she really is the stuff of dreams until the wrapper comes off. Doug McKeon plays the geek who becomes a prize himself. Catherine Mary Stewart is the nice girl that I wish had lived next door to me and Jami Gertz is the metamorphosed hormone miracle. The cast is rounded out by Chris Nash. Each does a good job in the role. Teen angst comes to the fore and a worthwhile story actually results. It was fun and bittersweet in the memories it conjured."	1
"Very short game, took about 2 hours to finish it (took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it, because as always their ""system is unavailable, please try again later"" - took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable, and definately it will be the last steaming product I buy). As to the game, you get 3 weapons and pretty much one set of scenary. Gameplay was average for a shooter. It seems ""episodes"" basically translates to ""really short game, which just randomly ends leaving you wondering if you missed something""."	0
"I have always had a morbid fascination with that segment of the population that believes that the Bible is the only book one has to read, and that great literature consists entirely of the Left Behind series.  I bought this movie to get a sense of this group.Banal is the kindest word I can find for this tripe.  Third rate actors, low-rent science fiction backdrops, and completely out of touch with reality.  The movie opens with the Israeli agricultural ""miracle.""  What it does not tell the audience is that Israel would be a dead state if it were not for the 20% of the Israeli government's budget funded by US taxpayers through the US Government's very unwise investment in this apartheid regime (see Jimmy Carter's new book) and if it were not for the blatant Israeli underground pipes that are literally looting the Arab aquifers at long range and from way beneath the earth.  Israeli agriculture is not a miracle, it is a travesty--it consumes 50% of all the water used in Israel, and produces less than 5% of the Gross Domestic Product.The movie goes downhill from there.  Just to place it in a proper religous movie context, if the ""Ten Commandments"" was a perfect 10, this movie is no more than a 1 and certainly not even close to a 2"	0
"Although I'm a diehard fan of this great British sitcom, I can't recommend this particular DVD of it. When I received it I was shocked by the fuzzy quality of the recording. Comparing it side-by-side on the same TV with an old VHS recording I purchased years ago clearly showed that the DVD image quality was much poorer than the VHS. I believe what the makers did was transfer from a second or third generation VHS copy of the original recording to DVD instead of going back to the original. The focus is so soft that both my wife and myself constantly squinted in an effort to sharpen the image, which of course didn't help. I doubt we'll ever watch this DVD because the eyestrain is too great. If you don't have a good copy it would be better than nothing, but not by muchI was also disappointed in the extras. The ""character biographies"" weren't of the characters in the series but of the actors; very misleading. There were no tours of the actual estate used in the series or many of the other additions that would have made this a first rate DVD. The radio broadcasts were interesting, though several different actors were used which degraded the enjoyment. Also, there were only four of the ten radio broadcasts on the DVD. Finally, while you listen to the radio shows only one image is displayed on the TV screen. This can lead to screen burning on some sets."	0
Nothing. Not even a trailer. What a wasted opportunity for a commentary by West (who does do them -- he did one for When A Stranger Calls) or a retrospective featurette.All you do get with this extended version is additional dialogue between Cusack's character and a female law enforcement officer in a hanger, footage of a prison riot during the opening credits montage and a few more graphic shots of hapless inmates being killed during the course of the movie	0
"Absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I saw it first in 1995 on video, I believe.  Never saw it or heard of it on the big screen.  Anyway, it's proof positive that a great directorial job, with actors (human and animal) who believe in a story about real human failings, lightheartedness and heroics can turn a pretty good screenplay with wonderfully charming dogs into one with a real impact on your life.  I had to see it again a couple of years later just to make sure it was as good as I thought. It deals with real suffering (including death, revenge, and anger) and then redemption.  Don't look for the classic happy ending, but an ending which is consistent with the themes in the movie and is very satisfying, after a little thought. The movie completely pulls you in (without your realizing it) and works its magic on your mind.  But, don't expect it to be powerful though you will notice tears forming frequently throughout the movie, often unexplained at first.  ""Fluke"" also seemed to leave me a little wiser and more understanding and compassionate toward my family, especially. I sort of got it the next day! And, you will love ""Fluke"", the dog! The movie is about a dog, but it's really about so much more. Even though the dog scenes are great, the subject matter at times is rather charged and there is violence and death (human and animal), so please be prepared to talk about it with your kids if they watch it with you"	1
I look at the average raiting for this movie. # stars, now thats supposed to mean its ok. Well ppl, this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves. I read some review saying the musicwas good, and, well, from my perspective It seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments. Like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment, and i would almost barely knotice, if it wasnt for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense. It was like they didnt know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here. Save your money. I bought this after seeing the first, which was lame, but i though it was ok, and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something. Well this was in 6th grade. HUGE mistake i hated it when i first saw it. It seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it. And about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play. Good, considering its live, but lame as far as movies get. Oh, and the villians who were supposed to seem smart or truly evil, just seemed spiteful and annoyingly upsessed with killing. I really think this is one of the most absolutely stupid films ever made. But that was untill I saw reptillian. Which is kinda depressingly awfull	0
Having visited St. Petersburg, Russia a year ago, I could not pass up the chance to watch this movie.  I must say, it was nicely done.  I can relate to the obnoxious, business like brother...who happily did not go with me on my trip.  I was more like the care-free younger brother, but not quite so care-free as the character protrayed.  The scenery was awesome...all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent buildings and sculptures were in the movie...although I wish there were more because the city is full of beauty.  And this goes for the women as well!!  I mainly went to see the city...but I also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that I planned would be my travel companion.  What I didn't expect was to really fall in love :-).  The BIG reason why I confirmed myself to be a life time bacholar was my exposure to American women...as if explained in the additional extras on the DVD...but the Russian lady that I met there and the culture of her up-bringing quickly changed my way of thinking!!  One thing I should add though.  The movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you when you go back to the states yourself.  Such is not the case.  It takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here...expect at least 8 months, but it is more like a year.  It is time consuming to get her a US visa.  But she was worth the wait for me and if you want a life long partner and lover, the wait is worthwhile.  Another word of caution:  Prepare yourself to fall in love with Russia...the people are very nice and I know of a lot of Americans who go there quite often to visit and re-visit...some even live there now	1
"If you can't get enough of zombie comedies this year, I seriously recommend this one, made in the Czech Republic of all places! I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival (NY) and it was tremendous fun. Bloody, funny, and smart. An intellectual twist on the ""secluded retreat"" idea - a group gathers at a hotel to do a weekend course about the meaning of their lives. And of course, they're overrun by zombies.I especially love the way the film weaves between existential exploration and hilarious gore-fest. It works on so many different levels - while your first reaction to it may be mostly visceral, your attention will soon shift to the clever jokes, the interesting characters, and the joyful way it plays with film conventions.This is a rare and unusual film to come out of the Czech Republic. I was disappointed that it didn't get a theatrical release in the US, so I'm really glad that it's coming out on DVD. Humor/horror fans will not be disappointed!"	1
With so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie, but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down. Matthew McConaughey delivers another good performance, yet doesn't stray too far from what he knows best. There is Bradley Cooper as his best friend who you will remember as Rachel McAdams fiance in wedding crashers. Patton Oswalt appears in a blink and you'll miss him scene, but the heros of the day are Kathy Bates and Zooey Deschanel who's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play. Bates is great as McConaughey's mother while Zooey is at her sarcastic best as Parker's flatmate. Parker should stick to television, she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role, maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie. A good date movie flick, the story is predictable but I would have been willing to look past that had I been entertained.Special features are nothing too special. A trailer and a few dodgy featurette's. A rainy night rental movie	0
This movie is possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Christopher Nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies.  This movie is very unique and will never get old	1
At last!  A full-length Jimmy Buffett concert on DVD!  It's been a while coming but this is a beauty.  There are so many highlights it's hard to know where to start - perhaps the best place is the overall quality of the DVD.  The sound is superb, the camera-work spot on and the real essence of a Jimmy Buffett concert is captured perfectly.  The song mix is terrific - everything from Buffett classics like Volcano, to new classic like Piece Of Work, to iconic covers like Southern Cross.  Seeing Jimmy and the Coral Reefers perform in daylight and night-time is a nice touch and the crowd shots show why a Buffett concert is such an all-encompassing experience!  For me, a favourite moment is the concert finale of Steve Goodman's City Of New Orleans.  Steve now resides under home plate at Wrigley and I'm sure he was singing along as well.  Buffett fans and new Parrotheads alike will find this DVD one to watch many times over	1
&quot;Above Suspicion&quot; offers both a plausible plot and realistic character portrayals. The dilemma of the story becomes apparent when a family man's (Bakula's) past comes back to haunt him, consequently tearing his life and his family apart. His wife (Sciorra) becomes more and more unsure of her husband as the story progresses. &quot;Above Suspicion&quot; has the qualities of an intense psychological thriller, as well as a heart warmer. It's a must see for almost any movie fan. Just don't confuse this &quot;Above Suspicion&quot; with the film starring Christopher Reve	1
The only reason I'm reviewing this movie now is because I just watched it on TV today. And the only reason I watched it was because nothing else was on. So...No, let's be fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though, because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was proven right.Analyze That illustrates perfectly why `sequel' sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that is why they fail time after time.So what does this movie have? A great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and? Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that. A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile on several occasions. But that isn't enough. There are thousands of comedy films out there; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable, and producers think they'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas. Newsflash: think again. Nobody watches these movies. There's no reason to when you can just watch the original again	0
I received this in a speedy manner. And it was in great condition. I would buy from this person again	1
I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie.	0
"First of all, let me tell you, this is NOT a date movie.  This is the most brutal graphic rape movie I have ever seen, and also one that lingers in your mind long after it is over.  For me, that's exactly what I want when I see a movie, one that leaves a lasting impression no matter how difficult the impression might be.  I loved this movie, because it is very very well made, and the acting performances are incredible.  Yes, the rapes are unforgiving in every respect, and the misery throughout the film is almost difficult to watch at times.  This is not a gory movie, except for the last ten minutes, it is a very disturbing movie and it does have a fair amount of nudity, however it really needs to.  ""The Untold Story"" and ""Ebola Syndrome"" offset much of the carnage with humor, but ""Red to Kill"" has absolutely NOTHING to smile about.  It is totally and brutally serious from the first frame to the extremely nasty ending.  The story is pretty simple, a psycho-rapist is on the loose and he's going after a mentally retarded young dancer.  In the second graphic rape of the movie he does the deed to the young lady.  Enter a female social worker who tries to help the victim, and dreams up a plan to get even with the rapist after he gets off in court because of a stupid technicality.  Her plan succeeds to a certain extent, but not like she planned it, and the rapist comes after her full force.  The actor who plays the rapist is absolutely sensational, and I might add, the musical score is perfect.  The music adds so much to the all ready existing tension from all the horrific acts.  The actress who plays the retarded girl is also amazing, one of the best performances on film you will ever see.  To end this, this is a must-see movie for fans of this genre, and I'm just getting started myself.  Not the gore associated with the two previous Cat III movies I watched, but something even more terrible and unrelenting, and an uneasy feeling that will not leave you anytime soon after you see it.  ""Red to Kill"" is flatout a good movie, even considering the subject matter.  I highly recommend it"	1
I loved these movies, And I cant wiat for the third one! Very funny, not suitable for chilren	1
"I agree with the negative comments - I eventually stopped watching it - unconvincing acting - (and a small point that I found irritating - in TV movies about war, some of them have a ""too-clean look"" that make a film seem unrealistic. There is no dirt anywhere, as far as I could see - everybody looks too clean, the settings look too clean, and not realistic. The acting level was what finally turned me off. Glad it was on TV"	0
"Based on the bestselling novels by Michael and Jeff Shaara, ""Gods and Generals"" and ""Gettysburg"" (based on the elder Shaara's ""The Killer Angels"") are the most excting and emotional Civil War epics ever filmed. The battle scenes are the most exciting and realistic Civil War battle sequences ever put on screen. The acting is phenomenal, with the likes of Jeff Daniels, Stephen Lang, Tom Berenger, Robert Duvall, Bruce Boxleitner, Martin Sheen, Richard Jordan, Sam Elliott and Mira Sorvino, but to name a few of the fine actors and actresses in these two movies. Director Ronald F. Maxwell has created a masterpiece with his first two films, giving rise to the hope that the last film, ""The Last Full Measure,"" will complete what will hopefully be the best Civil War trilogy ever made!""Gods and Generals"" Movie/DVD Grade: A+""Gettysburg"" Movie/DVD Grade: A+Overall Grade: A+"	1
Very good movie.  Great acting & plot.  Very touching.  I am very glad I own this movie.  I will watch it very often	1
"I saw this back in 1985 when if first came out.  It was wonderful.  At first, I thought it was going to be one of those historical/tourist shows.  But it wasn't.  It could have been, though.  Mr. Wood is a very charismatic presenter.  But is what's better is that he took the story of the story of the Trojan War from the pages of modern myth to reality.  I have read Homer and I knew about Schlieman, but other than that, I was ignorant of the Trojan War.Mr. Wood started with what a regular person knew about the war and then took it into deeper level.  I was fascinated by the connection he made to the Hittite Empire.  The thought had never occurred to me that if a Troy did exist, it might have trade relations with empires to the east.  He also included experts in the fields of archeology, modern history and history of the period.I thouroughly enjoyed the dvd and have seen it several times.  I also have the Alexander dvd and Shakepeare.  ""In Search of Shakespeare"", was fun.  Wood took the story of Shakespeare down to the center of his human story.I would recommend all the Wood ""In Search of..."" programs.  If you can't find the films, then read the books.  The books are just are entertaining."	1
We purchased this DVD because we really need to work with our son on his reading and it's a great supplement to reading books.  He loves this DVD and we love the variety in it's approach.  We didn't realize until we watched it with our kids that so much of what we viewed as children really stuck with us through the years	1
"I have to admit that I actually enjoyed this movie. I certainly liked it better than ""Red Planet"". I believe ""Mission to Mars"" to be the better of the two movies. It has a stellar cast and, I thought, good on screen chemistry between the actors. Most of the special effects were excellent. All in all, it is a good directorial effort by Brian De Palma.Somehow, however, this has become the movie that viewers love to hate. Well, I am afraid that I disagree, as I found it to be a pretty decent sci-fi move. Of course, I am partial to this genre of film, so perhaps that may account in part for my liking this movie. The premise of this movie is simple. A crew is sent on a mission to Mars. The mission is disrupted when three of the four crew members are killed by an unknown energy force emanating from a strange metallic composition in the soil. A new crew of four go on a rescue mission. These four, Tim Robbins, Connie Nielsen, Gary Sinise, and Jerry O'Connell, make up the rescue crew. Due to problems encountered in space, only three of the four make it to Mars.When they get to Mars, they find the surviving crew member. Debriefing him of the events that led to the destruction of the mission, they discover that the metallic composition in the soil is, in fact, a giant metallic head made in the image of man. Therein lies the mystery. What they eventually discover astounds them and makes one of them decide to go where no man has gone before. The ending is somewhat reminiscent of a combination of the movies, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" So, I ask you, how bad can this movie be? On the contrary, it is actually pretty good. Better yet, it can be watched by the entire family"	1
Don't know about anyone else, but the DVD I purchased had lousy video.  The only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots. All of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either. I know the concert was indoors, but I've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem.  Did I get a bad DVD or did anyone else have this problem	0
I love the FIRM workouts, and I love the instructor Allie, so I was so excited to try this new workout.  I was unfortunately extremely disappointed.This workout was not complicated, but it also wasn't much of a workout.  I didn't get my heart rate up at all, and didn't break a sweat.  Some of the moves are just not very good, and having to repeat them everytime we add on got really annoying.The disco part was my favorite, but overall, this is a workout that I can honestly say I would rather have the money then the workout.  I will keep it and periodically do it on a VERY light day or in addition to another workout, but that's just because I have it.  I've tried a couple other of the new FIRM workouts that are more worth the money...this one I am sad to say is not.	0
I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!   Unsatisfied customer	0
I collect 1950s era Sci-Fi and I have been replacing my VHS versions with DVDs.  Unfortunately, I need to keep my VHS version for this movie because the print that Image Entertainment made this from was in such poor shape.  The VHS version by UAV Entertainment (The Wade Williams Collection) is MUCH better.  Hopefully, UAV will come out with a DVD version soon	0
"The original ""Candyman"" sucks so bad, but everybody praises it and I kept wondering to myself, ""am I missing something?""  So, I tried watching it again and it still sucked as I could not even get through it, so I figured maybe I should watch the sequels and maybe I would find something that I liked about this series.  Well, after watching ""Candyman 2"", one becomes cognizant that this series is just full of rubbish...again, the social overtones and politically correct notions present in this series make the movie absurd in the extreme.  The villain in ""Candyman"" makes me want to laugh because he is so NOT scary...if you want a good laugh, watch the ""Candyman"" series, but if you want to be scared, you would even do better to watch ""Ren and Stimpy"".  In all seriousness, watch ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II"" if you want to see a good slasher and horror movie that really produces the goods and doesn't try to send a social message. LOL.  Some people call ""Candyman 2- Farewell to the Flesh"" a horror movie...I just call it rubbish"	0
"I was GREATLY disappointed in this DVD. Here's why:1. It's basically 60 minutes of warming up2. The level 3 (advanced) is not THAT HARD.3. The annoying ""inhale, exhale"" chant really makes it difficult to find my 'center.' I just wanted to tell her SHUT UP4. I didn't break a sweat once. 5. I used it twice and never plan to use it again. I mean, c'mon, I don't want to waste 1 hour of my day on something that won't get me results. I must say the ONLY THING positive about this DVD is the landscape. In short, rent this from Blockbuster or buy it used. Don't waste any more than 5 bucks on this. It's not worth it. "	0
I thought I was getting a look into Jay-Z's and Roc-a-fellas world.  Maybe a documentary i thought?  Maybe a movie i thought?  Instead this was the worst attempt at a movie, video whatever they called it EVER.  This thing is horrible.  The only good part is Jay Z rapping the scenarios he is in.  Thats cool for like 2 mins.  At times its like a porn video.  I wanted to get into Jiggas world but all this DVD did was make the world a worse place to live in because of how horrible it is. The crap sets in again over and over all across the plate.  Even the biggest Hova fans should stay away.  Dont buy this	0
In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one. Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas --- especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable, Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda,  The memory of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going. And make one yearn for Mickey and Judy	0
This film is among the worst, most pointless, and most inane garbage that I've ever had the misfortune to view. Contrary to popular belief the alien was not cute he was CREEPY! The little boy was extremely annoying, and his relationship with the alien made me ill! Actually it made me more than ill, it was down right disturbing! His bond with the alien was one of the most freeky thing I have ever had to witness, and the kids family was just obnoixious. By the time the alien go home no one really cares anymore. You are just relieved that the film is finally over. Watch it only to say that you've seen this.	0
i would have liked a more real story in this dvd	0
"This disc is pure gold! Featuring a FULL live performance from their 2004 European tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate Stray Cats fan collectible! The concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80's. They show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show. They go through all their classics and then some. Whether it's ""Stray Cat Strut"" ""Gene And Eddie"" or ""Rumble In Brighton"" what you see and hear on this disc is flawless. Must buy for ALL music fans, not just fans of the Cats"	1
"I would often rush to see all Arnold Schwarzenegger films, i adore his bad acting ""it must be the muscles"" i was 10 year old and he was the bomb now his movies now gives me a pain in my stomach and i start to twitch, i can't believe how terrible an actor this man was ""IS""  and all the money he made doing these unrealistic bull crap, wow! talk about the American dream, i admit there are some of his movies i would have to rate a classic but however this one really sucks maybe it was the time,trend, maybe the era, but i have come a long way and this guy is a difinite no! no! for me, this movie had it's moments! for a 8 year old maybe! for an adult you have to have a strong stomach, you i would never say this about Bruce Willis mybe i am a hypocrite or maybe he just an good actor duh! i couldn't care less do with this what you will i won't recommend it later folks"	0
What a horrendous experiment in comedy...if you like Jerry Lewis, I guess you'll love this travesty of a film.  If you are a film snob, you will love it.  Personally, as neither, I am grossly disappointed and just really didn't get &quot;the joke.&quot;  It was trite and dull....there was no point....the plot...technology encroaching on humanity....well, good try, but again not for me.  If I am looking for a laugh, I will watch a good Coen brothers film	0
A Star Is Born is a disturbing film for all the wrong reasons.  By failing to get the audience to sympathize with a movie star's tragic downfall, the film displays a schizophrenic quality. There is almost a breakdown in the relationship between the audience and what happens on screen.  This is in no part due to the performances by the lead actors; it's the nature of the material itself.  Perhaps if we were to see the James Mason character as a likeable star before failure and booze drain away his ambition and reason for living, the audience would understand what the Garland character sees in him and we could sympathize with both characters.  Instead, we see Garland's character despairing over a not very likeable washed-up drunk and we're left feeling as empty as the film itself	0
First of all, yes, this film was made in Vancouver, with only a few shots of the Manhattan skyline. When Golden Harvest was making this film, they had to try their best to shoot at angles that didn't show any mountains, and they had to paint grafitti each day and unpaint it each night. Then Jackie Chan told them to simply forget all of that and focus on the action.Well, action was what they focused on the most indeed. It sure is funny to see how the Chinese thought of the United States at this time, because what you see in this film are hippies that drive around in trucks full of beach balls. You also get multi-ethnic gangs trashing places (seriously, the gang has a Native American with pigtails and a frayed jacket! That's almost offensive). You have fat cops that just sit around smoking cigars. You have random, small-crowd rock concerts where everyone is dressed up in animal suits! Bizarre indeed.As for the actions, this film has some of his best. The first fight scene in the grocery store is supurb, and graceful, using his jacket to dispatch enemies, and endlessly hitting the same guy in the nose over and over. He takes on the entire gang in a back alley before getting cornered, very impressive. This leads to a scene where he's being chased around the streets of New York, where the entire gang, on motor cycles, try to run him over, and Jackie must rely on his ability to run like the wind and climb like a monkey. He also does a dangerous stunt where he jumps from the roof of a parking garage onto a fire escape of another building. No harness or wiresupport! The fight scene at the gang's hideout is also one his best, using whatever object he can get his hands ont, and very acrobatic. Also, Jackie Chan has to cling to a hovercraft while it drives on water and land! Some of this was done on a broken ankle!If this DVD was uncut and undubbed, and had the original score, I'd give it a total of three stars. Unfortunately, for a so-so film, New Line makes it worse. Some of the dubbing is very bad. It seems as if New Line dubbed some of the original English dialouge also. Only very, very little of the original Cantonese dialouge is there. Also, the film's original score has been redone to a more orchestrated score with slight rock. Many, many scenes were cut from the original movie. Not only that, but some of the action scenes were cut too. Try and find an uncut version out there. This DVD you should stay away from	0
A DVD with a message that pulls at the heart, and presents sadness and then joy to the viewer. Strong singing cast with excellent voices. A must see	1
This is the WORST transfer to DVD I've ever seen!!! I think the VHS copy looks and sounds better, do NOT waste your money!!	0
perhaps the greatest cinematic experience of our generation.  although, I believe I was in a different state of mind when I watched this stuff in college.  brilliant	1
This DVD is amazing!  Perfectly puts the Blues on display through the high-points and the low points of the season.  The best thing about this dvd, besides the flying, is the respect they show the crew.  Yeah, the pilots get the glory and do the high flying cool stuff, but, they are FAAAAR from the stars of the show!  The maintainers and support people behind the flying is where the stars hide.  This dvd also shines the light on the pilots and what they do.  They truly go through the mill, but, they don't do a single thing with those Blue jets if the crew does not do their job perfectly.  This is FINALLY a dvd that shines the light on the pilots, BUT, makes it clear that nothing happens without the crew in support of the pilots.  Great Job!!!    Unlike the retired one who reviewed also (great review by the way!!!!), I would not like to be a pilot after seeing this!  I would rather get FAAAR more reward working in my support role and knowing that the pilot gets his glory only because my ability to do the work allows it	1
"It's difficult to identify the exact pinnacle of Alfred Hitchcock's masterworks, especially as he had a most fruitful period during the 1950's until the 1960 classic ""Psycho"", but 1946's ""Notorious"" is arguably his most perfectly crafted and cast film. First, there is a sharp, intensely plotted script by the estimable Ben Hecht that focuses on Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted Nazi spy, and T.R. Devlin, an American agent hired to convince Alicia to spy on a clandestine group of neo-Nazis based in Rio de Janeiro. This means she would have to seduce and eventually marry Alex Sebastian, a key group member who has never gotten over Alicia in his heart.This triangle is embodied by three stars at the height of their powers. A primarily poker-faced Cary Grant portrays Devlin close to the vest and charismatically hides his emotions under a veil of cold arrogance. In a series of scenes that pierce with a subverted eroticism, Devlin falls in love with Alicia but cannot find the courage to admit that to himself or to her. Claude Rains, on the other hand, imbues Sebastian with such an open romanticism and sad streaks of jealousy that we can actually sympathize with a Nazi war criminal a year after WWII ended, quite a daring feat within the film's historical context.At the vortex, though, is Ingrid Bergman, who probably gives her most accomplished performance as Alicia. At the time, she was deified as the chaste Mother Superior in Leo McCarey's harmless ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" with Bing Crosby. Bergman turned a smart corner here as a ""loose"" woman in love with the bottle until she is transformed by her love for Devlin, at which point, she becomes a stylish decoy to draw the nave Sebastian to her alluring charms. Ethereally beautiful and constantly pained, she conveys much of her character's feelings through her eyes and subtle facial expressions because she and Grant portray two people who can't admit they desperately want to be together even if her life depends on it. Their failure to communicate leads to Alicia sinking deeper into the morass of some nasty espionage business that ultimately puts her life in jeopardy.The chemistry between the two legends is palpable, especially in the then-controversial, three-minute kissing sequence that put censors into a tizzy. However, above all, this is a Hitchcock film, the film is filled with his genius for ingenious subjective camerawork and suspenseful set pieces, the latter perfectly illustrated by the party sequence at Sebastian's mansion starting with an unbelievable dolly shot right into Alicia's hand clasping the cellar key, which she passes to Devlin to find what is being hidden in the wine bottles. There are intriguing performances on the sidelines with Louis Calhern as the head of the American agency in Rio and the intimidating Madame Konstantin as Alex's ice-cold mother, both displaying a Machiavellian spirit to get what they want.The Criterion Collection has done another masterful job with their DVD package, including an alternative audio commentary track featuring renowned Hitchcock scholar Marian Keane providing insightful scene-specific analysis and film historian Rudy Behlmer. As was common with movie hits of the day, the movie was recreated in condensed form for radio, and the 1948 Lux Radio theater adaptation starring the voices of Ingrid Bergman and Joseph Cotten is included as well. There are also lots of still photos, a collection of trailers and teasers, and even production correspondence and script excerpts of deleted scenes and alternate endings for the more anal-retentive among us. This is a true classic and required viewing for any fan of Hitchcock, Bergman, Grant or Rains"	1
For being such a perky story, with some steamy scenes this film rescues the genre of erotic comedy films	1
THE MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN WILL KEEP YOUR CHILDREN IMUSED FROM THE VERY BEGINING. THE MUSIC IN CORDINATION WITH THE MUPPETS OF ALL DIFFERENT KINDS KEEP THE MINDS OF YOUNG CHILDREN GOING AT ALL TIMES.I WOULD RECOMEND THIS MOVIE WOULD BE GREAT FOR CHILDREN STARTING AT AGE 2.5 AND OLDER	1
I absolutely loved this DVD.  I saw in on TV, but wanted a permanent edition for my 'supes' collection.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the history of Superman, its origins and where he fits into our culture today.  It's great	1
I STILL have not received this DVD.  It was ordered on 12/8/06 and was supposed to ship on 12/12/06.  I am very upset that it did not arrive as it was a Christmas gift.  I cannot rate the product as I don't have it.  I sent an e-mail through Amazon to jrmovies several days ago and have not heard from them.  I would appreciate a response or a refund	0
"I finally found out this was out on DVD after having the VHS version for many years.  The DVD edit is very close to the VHS version minus the glitch during the scorpions opening act, plus some video strobing added during Cindy Lauper's run down the runway, which I'm not sure was really needed, but I'm ok with it, although the video strobing was done again later, which seems to me as a cheap effect, that really doesn't add to the performance.I think Brian Adams and Cindy was excellent for the parts they portraid.  I thought originally sinaed (sp? whatever) was a strange choice at the time, maybe good for the part, but after seeing the documentary, I see her being a good intention decision at the time that ended up biting them in the end.  She's too instable, and apparently did not realize the importance of such an event, nor did she show any respect for the part.  Speaking of which, all of those artists that were called to perform at this event, and didn't say Yes on the first call.... shame on you.  If Roger calls you for an event, you say YES, and put whatever you're doing aside, because this was way too big of an event to try to be politically correct with.I wish there were more documentary material with this DVD, as this was such a big event, there should have been more information.  I had heard in an interview before the show that Roger was once asked if he'd ever do the wall again, and he basically said ""If the berlin wall would ever come down, then I would consider doing it again"", and this was never mentioned in the Doc.Buy the video, even if you have the VHS, you'll enjoy it.... Still waiting for Pulse to be released as well, enjoy!"	1
"It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others.The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.  The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.  Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful!Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland.Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on.As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all.Finally, somebody shoot the ""Narrator,"" PLEASE!Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here.If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man."	0
Even though Tsui Hark is one of my favorite Hong Kong directors, this movie did not at all show his skill. The story was poor along with the actors performances. I may be a little biased since I love John Woo, and  Tsui Hark killed their friendship by making this movie. Worth checking out  but i would'nt buy it if I were you	0
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually HURTS to watch it.From the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters (odd, considering that in interviews after the first movie, all of them said they'd want/ be willing to come back for a sequel), to the horrible (even by 1997 standards) CG effects, to the cliched fight scenes (gee...two women in a mud pit.  I bet it took them all night to come up with that one), virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie DID go wrong with this movie.Loosely based on the story of the Mortal Kombat 3 video game (and set immediately after the first movie, which, while not great, looks like Citizen Kane compared to this stinkburger), the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting Shao Khan (played by Brian Thompson, the alien bounty hunter from The X-Files) and his army (shown in most scenes as a small band of extras.  Oooh...scary.) as they attempt to take over Earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as Outworld.  This merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity.With only a week to do anything about it, Lord Raiden (played by James Remar, replacing the, and I can't believe I'm saying this, much better Christopher Lambert in the role) once again enlists the help of Liu Kang (Robin Shou), Sonia Blade (Sandra Hess), and Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto), along with help from a select few other characters from the video games' crowded lineup, to prevent this from happening.The story in and of itself is not necessarily bad.  However, given the film's obviously low budget the weak screenplay, the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film, and most jarringly, direction even more inept than that of Paul W.S. Anderson, it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high, only to have practically everything come crashing down.The only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack, featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie, as well as music by KMFDM, Megadeth, Rammstein, Juno Reactor, and others.If ever you're looking to punish yourself for something, then by all means watch this movie.  However, if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself, you will avoid this movie like the plague.  Believe me, you'll thank yourself later.	0
"This is a good introduction to many off the beaten paths of America.  In fact, the real star of the show, asie from the ubiquitous red Ford Taurus, is the scenery of America itself.  The camera and narrator takes the viewers to many places that have unique characteristics.  Unfortunately there is no interaction with the locals so we do not get a truely complete coverage of each scene, but the point of the series is to give a ""Reader's Digest"" view of places people can visit.But excellent photography and the knack for finding out of the way events are the hallmark of this series. Each ""trip"" is actually a roundabout path that is really serveral ""family vacations"" combined into a one hour program. This is a great cure for cabin fever in the midst of a winter snowstorm"	1
I think a lot of people miss the power of this movie.  To me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by Ministries in this country.  Even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous TV Ministries today, the message is still clear.  Those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie.  This is certainly one of Burt Lancaster's better roles, and he plays it with much guesto! If we were to look at most of the popular Ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background.  This movie has a strong message.  Don't listen to the word of God from others.  If you must believe in the wild stories of the Bible, do so in your own way.  Do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money! Even in this modern day and age, the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong.  Mr. Bush and the Republican Party used it as a means to seek re-election!  Everyone who is a born again Christian, or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country.  The ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived, meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the Almighty (if there is one).  Still, a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today. 	1
"I saw Dead Ringers in the movies. The theater was filled with mostly couples. When it was over, as we walked out, laughter began to spread as we all recognized that we as couples were having the same conversation; ""Whose stupid idea was it to pay money to see this move""!"	0
"I was blown away by the wonderful acting of Juliet Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi who played the retarded young adults. This was a very compassionate film about the realities of living with a disability. Disabled people desire and deserve to have the same opportunities as everyone else. It was wonderful to see the love ""Carla""'s siblings and parents had for her. There were 2 reasons I didn't give this movie 5 stars. One was that Diane Keaton's character of the overly controlling mother was annoying. Obviously she was supposed to be annoying, but I think she overacted a bit and she needed better lines, she seemed to say the same stuff over and over again. Another reason I didn't love this film was because Hollywood once again compels right wing nut jobs to write reviews that portray themselves as normal and good. Sorry, Hollywood, but there will always be those of us who still believe God's word to be true. Being a right wing nut job isn't considered normal or ok in the bible. God never created it. Look it up. You are not helping people who struggle with it to be set free from that addiction and lonely lifestyle.  "	1
"I had several friends INSIST that I rent this film. I'm glad I did instead of buying it. I was not bowled over as they obviously were - quoting lines from it and all but wetting themselves remembering scenes from the film.Now, I'm not a hard guy to make laugh, but there was only one point in this film where I actually laughed out loud. Other than that, I found Sordid Lives to be just tediously amateurish and more than a bit forced.I love Southern humor and even poking fun at Southerners: I can't tell you how much I love Greater Tuna, Fried Green Tomatos, Steel Magnolias, etc. but this just didn't cut it for me.The cast is a who's who of excellent character actors: Beau Bridges, Bonnie Bedelia, Leslie Jordan, Olivia Newton-John (for pete's sake!), Erik Krieger, Delta Burke and gobs of others. No, it's not a shortage of talent that this film lacks. I found that it was a lack of a cohesive direction that made me wince more than once.There's a scene with Ty (an out of the closet to everyone but his parents young man who lives in West Hollywood) talking to his ex-girlfriend in the reception area of their therapist...well, as a theatre director, I can only tell you that the performances during this one scene are so painfully badly acted and the pregnant pauses between the lines are so large you could drive fleets of trucks through them.There are various filming techniques that Del Shores (the director) uses that are just hackneyed: filming from behind a person's back so that only the back of one person's head and the facing person are seen. Why? It feels like a testimonial ""video"" from MTV's Real World rather than an actual film.Frankly - and this is not always a bad thing - the whole film felt like it was a play converted to film. It can be a great thing! Look at Altmans' Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmy Dean and you'll see how a good stage to film movie is done. But this...well, it's just amateur hour from my perspective.In all, the film felt like a poor man's Greater Tuna (two quick change artists playing 16 characters living in Texas' 3rd smallest town), which WAS a stage play and WAS filmed for HBO as a stage play rather than attempting to make it FEEL like a film.I wanted to like this film, but I just didn't"	0
This movie was always a fun one to watch; however, after Katrina in New Orleans, it was the best comic relief on those days when it was all going wrong as we rebuilt the house. Love the movie	1

Treasure Island has that magical touch to it Walt Disney was famous for. Treasure Island teachers one at a young age not everone is who they seem. Lots of good guys and bad guys and Pirate Treasure leads to a wild ride! This film should be required for all youngsters! There is a special place in my heart for this film. This was Robert Newton's finest hour playing Long John Silver	1
I had the complete opposite experience with this workout than did the previous reviewer.  The combination of doing upper and lower body exercises simultaneously caused my heartrate to soar which caused symptoms of overtraining.  Many people love this video but I just had a bad experience with it	0
This movie is such a breath of fresh air. Finally there's a movie that's profound, amusing, and relatable. It's nice to watch something that really hits home without begin cheesy or overdone and you can never go wrong with Jean Louisa Kelly or Amanda Peet	1
For me, this movie is very different than other Holocaust movies, in that it explores the issue of what happened to Jewish spouses of Aryan women...the story itself is based on a true occurrence, and the movie begins with a wake...the widow is tormented by visions of her past in wartime Berlin & shows disapproval at her daughter's choice of a non-Jewish fiance...the daughter then discovers there is more to her mother's past than she was ever told, and travels to Germany to discover her mother's past...the story is told in flashbacks through reminiscences, and basically focusses on the plight of Aryan women in Berlin whose Jewish husbands have been confined in a place called Rosenstrasse...I won't give too much away, but I must say that for a slow-paced movie, it is quite gripping as we are kept guessing as to the final fate of the Jewish spouses...as for the acting, the characters from the past did an excellent job, their performances were very realistic, and heart-wrenching, especially the actress who plays the main role of Mrs Fabian Fischer, the Aryan wife. In the present day, the actress who plays the daughter who seeks to unearth her mother's past wasn't very convincing, but all in all the story itself makes up for other lacks in the movie, and it is definitely watchable for the unique plot	1
Though this movie is not the stage version, it is just as good!Bill Benson(Bing Crosby) and Ted Adams (Donald O Conner) decide to do a broadway show together. However, they need a leading lady. Well Ted and the director decide that if Bill should run across the right girl, sign her. So Bill sets off to Paris, and Ted for London. Well Bill discovers a girl(Mitzy Gaynor) not knowing that Ted found and signed a girl in Paris (Jeanmaire).When the two find out it is total chaos, especially trying to keep the two girls from finding out about eachother on the way home. All the while trying to get the other to tell their girl to leave. Things seem to be going fine, until the two men begin to fall in love with eachothers leading lady! The movie has GREAT Porter songs De Lovely, Anything Goes, Second Hand Turban, Blow Gabe Blow, I get a kick out of you, You're the Top, and a fabulous tap number with Donald: You Can Bounce Right Back. Phil Harris also stars in this fantastic, De Lovely movie!!	1
Okay, after reading several reviews, I decided to buy this anyway for a few laughs.  Boy did I get my moneys worth!  It was so incredibly BAD that I was first cringing in horror before I started laughing.  The characters, especially Hiei, were so screwed up and the voice dubbing was so unfamiliar that in the end it had me laughing.  Now, I'm a die hard yyh fan, but I give it high marks just because it was so much fun to watch.  Put me in a good mood for the rest of the day.  If you arent pressed for cash and up for a few laughs i'd definitely suggest  buying for th he11 of it	1
"This DVD version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable.  Hayley Mills is her usual irrepressible self, and the supporting cast is top notch. The feline actor in particular!  ;)I don't quite understand the anger from some other reviewers about the fullscreen format.  It didn't bother me at all.  Disappointment I could understand, but this kind of vitriol?  It's still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages, and I found it a refreshing change from the dumbed-down ""kid's"" movies they tend to make these days.  Adults will enjoy the suspenseful story, retro style, and feline antics just as much as kids will.  I'd skip the remake and get the original"	1
i totally agree with soda fizz because im 18 now and i grew up watching these old shows like doug, angry beavers, are u afraid of the dark, rocco, pete and pete, all that, etc...  they sould put those shows on in rotation and put them out on dvd, im sure there are tons of people out there who would buy them (me being one of them).  BRING BACK THE OLD SHOWS	0
"Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, ""The Descent"" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, ""The Descent""""The Descent"" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.Even though ""The Descent"" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.""The Descent"" is unrated and contains violence and language"	0
"I bought the DVD with this artwork out of a dollar bin and I got what I paid for. The image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality. This must have been taken from a 16mm print. It may be that this film is in public domain, so it may be difficult to find a decent quality DVD. There are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other DVD issues. Note: Amazon seems to spread these reviews across DVDs of the same title, so you may see this review under multiple DVD releases of ""Meet John Doe"".

"...and I can remember some of the scenes to this day (i'm 49 now). I was 16;my friend,17 at the time. I used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days,and after that movie, I didn't-for a long time. At the time it was a really scary film,and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story,which only added to the starkness of it. Of course,as some have opined here, what is perceived as horrifying then and what's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas.""Horror-and-brutality technology"" in films has definitely-and I use this word wryly-evolved"	0

Most people can't get enough of this movie. I even own it on laserdisc. When I saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on DVD, I had to have it.I am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality. It lookslike there was just a transfer from VHS to DVD. There doesn't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality. I recently saw it on HDNet Movies and thought it looked much better.DO buy this movie because it is an all time classic.Don't buy this movie if you think that the 20th Anniversary edition is going to get you anything better	0
No a very good video.  Poor quality.  Hard to follow.  Very much a cheat copy of the movie Gettysburg. 	0
good actors, great story... some good action too... this is great movie to help put together the bits and pieces of the stories you've heard about Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, and more.  It all may be true history, it may be fictional, it may just be myths mixed with fact, but whatever the case, there's more truth than not in this version of the 1870'	1
Loved them all ... found Victoria &amp; Albert and Lorna Doone a bit lacking.  Wondered about having more of The Scarlet Pimpernel offered - he's so smooth!  Tom Jones is very special - loved Sophie's father, he truly made the film.  As much as I liked him - hated Lizzie's mother in P &amp; P - what a ninny!  This is a great collection, would have liked to see Vanity Fair and Persuasion offered also	1
"I had high hopes for this series when I started watching it, though I guess the nonstop obscenities should have been the tip off that under all of that visual masterwork and spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked an twisted message that wasted ten hours of my life to discover.  Shandala is truly a wonderful character, pure and good, and the characterization of her is very tender, so by episode 21 or so the storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful and uplifting.  Oh, how wrong of me to think so, because for all of the philosophical and religious trappings, the message of ""hope"" the marketers promise is that the characters learn in the end that the villain's demented plan to save the world is really more effective than their spiritualities and that the ""truth"" is that the emotional and physical torture and destruction of an innocent, good woman is the only way to save the world!  Spare me.  And if you think that I am disgusted by this message, just imagine what the Muslims will think when they see what becomes of all of that quoting of the Koran and the Muslim character's final opinions.  Although the story is technically good, I'm only giving it one star for the message of despair.   "	0
My main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of Echo Park, a little area nestled next to downtown Los Angeles. I moved to Echo Park in late 2004.It's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs, dropping-out, and  domestic violence. And it's all here, told through the eyes of Latina teenagers. It was easy to see the woman's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played.I didn't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven. I also found myself not caring about any of the characters. So-and-so gets shot, la la loo goes to jail. Whatever!As an aside, though, the evil neighborhood druglord was called Ernesto. It turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called Ernesto. Luckily, it's just a coincidence	0
"There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this ""movie"" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is ""touched"" by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle... Need I say more?The plot, the ""humor,"" the dialogues, and the music are way beyond ""below average.""There is next to no nudity and there are no, I mean 0 as in ZERO beautiful girls, in this film!As for the acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors!  It is truly sad... Rent or buy (ha ha ha) at your own risk.  You have been warned!"	0
If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them.  This movie was not scary.  It would have been suspenseful if I cared for any of the characters.  You know what the best part was?  When it was over.Few movies compel me to write reviews, good or bad.  This one obviously did	0
"I'm not sure what compelled me to seek out ""Americano,"" written and directed by Kevin Noland.  It's not as if I was dying to check up on the career of Joshua Jackson, a star of TV's ""Dawson's Creek.""  Perhaps I was intrigued by Dennis Hopper's inclusion in such a small scale production--I mean the man is always interesting even when his material is less than stellar.  Here, however, the lure for him seems to have been his daughter Ruthanna, who has a supporting role and serves as a producer on this film.  Maybe it was international star Leonor Varela, a beauty who is surely one good role away from making it big in America.  Most likely, though, it was the idea of seeing the movie as a travelogue of Spain.  With great scenery, bull fights, Hemingway, hard drinking and partying, the Running of the Bulls--the atmosphere alone might have made intriguing viewing.However, I am going to be rather hard in my assessment of this film.  I think Noland has talent and I look forward to other works.  The film is photographed well and has good performances.  My problem stems from the fact that there is absolutely no drama in this familiar coming-of-age story.  With an astounding lack of real character insight, this little production about characters at a crossroads falls absolutely flat.The setup is simple.  As recent college graduates, Jackson and two pals (who bicker comically) are spending the last few days of their vacation in Spain before Jackson must return to the ""real"" world and a new job.  Facing the eternal struggles between childhood and adulthood, work and independence, freedom and monotony, dreams and reality--Jackson falls into lust with a local played by Varela.  Should he ditch it all for this worldwind romance?  Should he abandon responsibility for a life of leisure?  Should he stay in Spain?  These are legitimate questions and a legitimate, albeit familiar, story path.  What makes ""Americano"" so tedious and uninvolving, however, is that the film doesn't allow you to know its characters.  A character study with no genuine character development seems a hard concept to pull off--and ""Americano"" doesn't succeed in doing anything remotely deeper than the superficial presentation of friends on vacation.  We never know anything about Jackson's job or life in America, or his dreams, passions, interests, etc...aside from this fleeting romance.  Sure, the film goes through the requisite motions--Jackson writes pretentious poetry and talks to statues of Hemingway, what else would you expect in Spain?  If he has artistic aspirations, however, the screenplay surely never develops this.  Lacking any real guidance as to what Jackson envisions for his life, I simply fell into the camp of ""who cares?""  There are plenty of authentic moments in the depiction of Spanish culture.  Dennis Hopper's role, however, as a club host is a complete misfire.  Ultimately, though, my genuine disinterest in the film comes from a screenplay that asks me to care but never goes beneath the surface for emotional truth and character depth.  Sure, Jackson's at a crossroads--but lacking any understanding of what he wants, it made no difference to me what he chose.  Sorry, but that's a big problem when it is your film's central theme.

She really brings a character to life.  And this short series of British comedy was really enjoyable	1
This effort shows it's age. In addition, there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo-scientific method somewhat reminiscent of Mengele. I suppose it's possible for it to be taken as tongue-in-cheek by those at the post-graduate level of study at the Cheech and Chong School of Anthropology. However, I have to admit I was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing	0
With a good script and a director better suited to the material (I've read Pedro Almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and Jonathan Demme was originally attached to direct), Asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star Natasha Richardson.  Unfortunately, the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms... a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession.The basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist's wife (an excellent Natasha Richardson) and one of the asylum's patients (an equally good Marton Csokas), under the watchful eye of the patient's doctor (Ian McKellen).  There are several plot twists in the last part of the movie, some of which seem quite preposterous, at least in the way the movie was shot.  The only reason to watch this movie is to see Natasha Richardson.  She does her best in spite of the choppy script, and she even won a Best Actress award in London for this film.  However, as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession, director David Mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job.  (In fact, I remember that in the promotional interviews Richardson, credited as an executive producer, sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out.	0

"It's always a shame to see a really talented actor/ actress star in a dud of a movie, but that's exactly what happened to Jodie Foster with 1979's ""Foxes"".  Directed by Adrian Lyne, who would later go on to direct the notorious ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Foxes"" is a cheap, lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life.  The movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another, making it hard to stay focused.  The movie isn't a TOTAL waste--a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention; and Jodie Foster, still under 18 when this was filmed, has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she isn't given much to work with.  Plus, that piano melody of Donna Summer's ""On The Radio"" which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel.  Overall though, ""Foxes"" really is pretty lousy and can't be given much of a recommendation"	0
My husband and I LOVED the original Amityville and were SO disappointed by this remake. With the special effects we have nowadays I thought this movie would have been great, I was wrong. It was pure Hollywood garbage.	0
"This series is exactly what the English love about mystery and crime.  It's a tad bit dull compared to what we are used to with cop shows and series like ""The Shield"".  That being said, this series is well done and does capture you over time.  Rather than individual crime stories, this series contains only one crime investigation.  If you like drama and cop stories, this is a good one"	1
"Just look how many are for sale, thats got to be a clue on how horrible this film is. It has so much nudity and bad language it was disgusting. I fastforwarded about 70% of the movie! and what got me was on the back it says ""Family-Friendly"" im still laughing about that! What has this world come to? I would never let my kids watch it let alone anyone! Even my husband was disgusted and wanted me to write this review so some poor person doesn't buy or rent this movie. Im embarassed that I rented it! Please turn away now"	0
This movie was just plain bad. It doesn't just stink, it reeks. If I was to say this movie was horrible that would be a compliment. I can't believe that the other reviews were so complimentary. It's the reason why I purchased the movie and I regret my decision. I should have read the reviews more closely. Some of the reviewers hadn't acutally seen the film while I am convinced that a few of the other reviews were written by people associated with the film. Everything about this movie is sup-par. The script was horrible. The sets amateurish. The dialogue stilted. (And not in the funny style reminiscent of the TV series - which I loved). There are a number of things about the movie that were warning signs that this movie was going to stink.First the only footage they used was from the Batman movie. Not the TV series. I have a feeling that the people who have the rights to the TV series realized that this movie was so bad they didn't want to associate themselves with it. They didn't use the original Batmobile but a cheap rip off. I could continue by why make you suffer.The chemistry between Adam West and Burt Ward is non-existent. And the chemistry between the `actors' playing Adam West and Burt Ward in the `flashback' scenes is substandard at best. This movie is beyond dreadful. There are cameos from a few villains from the original TV show but they're dreadful too. Not because they are bad actors but because the script and plot are that bad. I wish I could say I laughed. I wish I could say that I at least cracked a smiled but unfortunately all I can say is that I watched this movie in dead silence. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVI	0

We all feel alone at times... this is something 'lost in translation' brilliantly shows its audience.. Indeed loneliness often, paradoxically, occurs in highly populated areas.. It is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand out... Bill Murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy, who dosen't seem to quite know why he is where he is, and why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality.. This is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.. It captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top.. This also sort of represents the zenith of Bill murray's career and perhaps his best performance to date.	1
"The movie is one of my favorites, works on both a romantic level, and a comic level.  But where's the widescreen?  Todays consumers are more educated (THANK GOD) and they've almost stopped asking the stupid question ""Why watch widescreen, you lose the top and bottom of the movie?!""  They finally get that you are seeing MORE of the movie with widescreen and not less.  So how can I be expected to buy this DvD?  It is for all intents and purposes ""Incomplete"".  Who's going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it?  Buy this movie as soon as WS version becomes availible"	0
 Thank heaven for Larry David and Curb Your Enthusiam, or there would be nothing brilliantly entertaining and provocative to watch that wasn't political, except South Park & Reno 911, which are really in a different league altogether	1
"    While the story may be entertaining in its own right, and ANY chance to see Donald O'Conner dance is worth it, this can be a very disappointing film to Porter buffs.  The plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship. The story line is totally different and therefore some of Porter's original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of Sammy Cahn and James Van Huesen which do not live up to Porter's quality.     The best examples I can give is the fact that there is no Evangelist so the title song ""Anything Goes"" turns into a second act number, sung by Mitzi and chorus (with horrific word changes) and ""Blow Gabriel Blow"" becomes a finale in the broadway show (sung by the four main characters) that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with any character or plot line.    If you haven't seen it on stage it's pleasant enough, but if you're expecting the broadway show it's a major disappointment"	0
"HYPOCRISY ALERT! HYPOCRISY ALERT! I just wanted to get that out of the way right at the start. Not more than twenty-four hours ago I wrote a review waxing philosophic on the state of the modern horror film. I argued that fans shouldn't viciously tear apart every movie they find objectionable because the current spate of horror films is better than no horror films at all. In other words, we should accept the bad with the good rather than stop renting and thus face a potential drought of horror movies. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, I shall proceed to trash ""Adam & Evil."" I didn't set out to heap scorn on this film when I popped it in the DVD player a few weeks ago, although a cursory glance at the cover art sent a chill of disappointment through my body and I felt my heart sinking. In fact, nothing screams ""straight to video"" more loudly than a film entitled ""Adam & Evil."" Well, perhaps something like ""Adam & the Bollweevil,"" or even ""Adam & Evil Knievel"" might rank as likelier candidates, but you get the idea. ""Adam & Evil"" does not inspire confidence that I'm about to watch a slasher film on par with Carpenter's ""Halloween.""Right from the start of the film we learn the filmmakers have cast us into the ninth circle of clichd slasher film hell. The movie introduces us to the typical bunch of young airheads getting ready to embark on a camping trip out in the sticks. There is Seth (Kevin Robson), the goofy virgin who tries too hard with the ladies but hopes that the trip will finally cure him of his unwanted condition. Then there is the snotty and narcissistic brunette Yvonne (Erica Cerra). Next up is a staple of every poorly made horror film, the ever important ""loud guy"" Matt (Brody Harms). Along for the ride are Evelyn (Barbara Kottmeier), Adam himself (Sean Arnfinson), Adam's girlfriend Yvette (Lynsey Brothers), and a few other kids. I am willing to bet that as you look at this list you will notice the Eve connotation in the three girls' names, and that Seth is also a name pulled straight out of the Old Testament. Where Matt comes in is a mystery unless we look to the New Testament. Something tells me the Matthew responsible for the gospel didn't go around announcing to everyone who would listen that he wanted to be known as ""Matt."" Call it a gut feeling.Anyway, these dolts head out to the forest for a few fun filled days of gossip, drinking, and romping around in the water. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? See those bright objects moving in your peripheral vision? They're called red flags. Things get a little tense when they stop off at a local bar populated with the usual Hollywood redneck stereotypes in order to ask some questions only to discover that the locals, with the exception of the busty wife of the local sheriff, aren't interested in helping out. Too, a creepy park custodian stumbles into the campground and gives everyone a scare before scurrying back into the forest. If you think we'll see him again before the credits roll, that's one bet I won't take. I should also mention a couple of other potential stresses facing the group. Adam and his friend Matt did something quite idiotic a few years before--namely setting a house ablaze with fireworks that claimed the lives of the family living there--that continues to haunt them to this day. Too, one of the gals worries about a stalker boyfriend she recently broke up with. Both of these scenarios serve to provide us with potential red herrings in order to make the film more suspenseful. I laugh defiantly at such nonsense.I won't spoil the ending for you, but I will take a few seconds to describe the incredibly banal lead up to the ""twist"" ending. For a slasher film, ""Adam & Evil"" is downright puritanical with the red stuff. I felt like a bizarro Clara Peller hollering, ""Where's the gore?"" every time a killing went down. Seth, for example, perishes in his tent in a particularly bloodless, off camera fashion. A couple of the other kids meet their maker when they run into the killer while floating around on a raft in a pond, again a rather bloodless affair. The presence of a bow and arrows and a shed full of sharp instruments promised great things--a promise unfulfilled, unfortunately. ""Adam & Evil"" is one of the tamest slashers I have ever seen. What did they do, turn the script over to the Hayes Commission before shooting scenes? Note to aspiring filmmakers: if you're going to make a low budget slasher film that will never see a theatrical release, go over the top with the sauce. At least then you've got a shot at making a cult classic. And another thing: make sure you pick people with a modicum of acting skills instead of the mannequins posing as living beings in this film. Sure, you'll have to shell out a few more bucks, but it's worth it. Remember, unless I'm laughing so hard at the bad acting that the film achieves the coveted ""so bad it's good"" label, ham handed performances can only hurt you. Surprisingly, the DVD comes with a commentary track. Not that you'll want to listen to it, but there it is. We also get a few trailers for three other schlock films: ""Contagion,"" ""Hallow's End,"" and ""Asylum Days."" Forget about picking up a copy of ""Adam & Evil."" It's not the sort of film a hardcore horror fan wants friends to see prominently displayed on the movie shelf. There are plenty of other worthier slashers out there that demand your attention."	0
I would love to provide a review of this DVD, however since I've not received it, despite having placed my order in August (it's now November)and having written to Amazon Customer Service about the matter (as yet unanswered) I'm afraid any review will have to wait	0
       I'll start by saying all those people who think that american animated series are as good as it gets animation wise have been living under a rock since this series started 11 DVDS ago, and it continues with this volume. As for the episodes themselves, They were a good addition to the season because with the next two discs, everything comes to a head and resolves. Looking back on the four episodes, the only perceivable problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything that was going on at home in Japan. This was not enough for a point deduction. At the end of the day, anyone who likes a good series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this discs and all of the discs from both seasons. You will not be disappointed.	1

"Born in Steventon, Hampshire in 1775, Jane Austen was one of two daughters of the Reverent George Austen and his wife Cassandra. She was educated in Oxford and in Southampton, finally attending a boarding school in the Abbey gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. The environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family, something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth. Jane Austen's works are imaginative, full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time. Jane Austen wrote about society, about propriety and about etiquette. She was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others. Her study of human flaws and prsonal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters.Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in 1813 and it still enchants audiences all over the world. The first time I read this book, I read as a child, back in Cuba, ""Orgullo y Prejuicio."" The writings of Jane Austen shaped my perception of true love as I identified with the love between Elizabeth Bennet and her one and only, Mr. Darcy. With this BBC adaptation completed in 1996, I have been able to relive the experience of exposing myself to a classic, one of the best books ever written. With this BBC miniseries we feel as though we were reading the book, for the adaptation faithfully follows the author's writing. The filming is magnificent, offering us a view of gorgeous scenery, magnificent castles, and locations that bring the book to life, for we can see what we expected after reading the book. The love story presents the struggle of the times, as two individuals fall in love, regardless of class differences, or status, and yet, the antagonism and friction created as a result of said differences. Darcy is a wealthy single man who, upon meeting the family of Elizabeth, boisterous, non-polished, and simple, believes her to be beneath him. The meet at a dance where his best friend falls in love with Elizabeth sister, but Darcy thinks he knows Jane's heart not to be true to these emotions. Elizabeth overhears a conversation during the dance and feels insulted by the proud and distant Darcy, keeping her distance and yet, without her awareness, falling in love with him. Jane Austen is masterful at creating enough tension to keep us all in suspense as to the path these lives will take as some members of Elizabeth family make the wrong choices. The dialogue is almost verbatim to the book, making this series a true delight for those of us who identify with this work. Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth and Colin Firth as Darcy provide magnificent interpretations of this timeless classic, keeping us all dreaming of ever encountering love of this magnitude in our lives. As with most DVDs that we own, we watch by selecting English subtitles, which enhances the viewing by allowing us NOT to miss a single word said by the characters. Who would want to miss a single word in this marvel of the English language? There is a documentary as an additional bonus, where interviews with cast members are included... simply awesome! Interviewed are:  Jennifer Ehle [Elizabeth], Colin Firth [Darcy]. We also get to see those who played Mary Bennet [Lucy Briers], Mr. Collins [David Bamber, Mr. Bingley [Crispin Bonham-Carter] and Mr. Wickham [Adrian Lukis]"	1
This has a run down of the colts season from game one to the Super Bowl.Thats it.Do not expect the Super Bowl without commercials and edited down because thats not what this is.Very disappointing.The AFC championship game of the week is just a post game show.I would have loved to see at least the 2nd half of that game.It was better then the Super Bowl.The only good things where the few extras with Manning and Harrison wired for sound.I hope there is a better one come'n cause this is not worth much	0

"This movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand - portraying the Gospel of John beautifully through the movie - and slapping Yahushua/Jesusand serious scholars in the face with the other hand.  The so-called ""scholarly""comments, for example about how the Gospel was written 200 years after the events, are by and largeintellectually dishonest and quite simplyinaccurate.  Even the lowliest of Bible scholars, if honest, will realize this.It is very sad to see people making a buck off the Bible, while trying to tearit down at the same time.  The worst examples of Scripture put downs are in the 3rdDVD.  I gave the movie to a relative without that add on"	0
I hated, hated, hated, hated this movie. It didn't make sense to me. To depresssing	0
Bad, bad, bad.Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing.I was sort of neutral about DiCaprio until I saw this steaming pile of bad acting. Consequently, since seeing this, I haven't voluntarily watched another DiCaprio performance.It was a huge mistake by the director (or the screen writer) to NOT set this in the era in which Jim Carroll grew up. Or if it was meant to be, it failed astoundingly with glaring anachronisms	0

"This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new ""teen speak"" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out."	0
"Who would give the green light to this? It is a total remake of the 1968 classic. The only difference is that there is  a slight revamp to reflect modern times. Since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it...it pales in comparison to the original. This was really weird to remake this movie. ""Dawn of the Dead"" was cool b/c it had a new, fresh spin to the story. This has no scares, no atmosphere, no innovations and no riveting performances. Skip this one "	0
"Sorry, but this movie BLEW!  The premise was there, but the delivery just sucked.  I can only take the suspension of belief so far.  We are supposed to believe that this guy has never told his new gf (whom he's been w/for at least a year) about his last, one before that, and gf before that.  At least two of them have his home phone number: they've never called? She's never seen the caller ID?  She's never answered the phone? Give me a break!  THen she holds fake interviews with the exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms. She meets up with Joyce (the most recent) whom she finds out that she genuinely likes, and starts believing that the bf should really be with her.  Joyce is none the wiser, but if you ask me, Joyce had stalker qualities b/c she harassed him when he was with the model, calls his house right back when she gets the call on her phone, keeps that stupid boomerang IN A FRAME, etc.  This chick, Stacy (Brittany M) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where this was ultimately going. Holly Hunter's character is precisely why I have more male friends than female. Stacy just met this woman and she's revealing all these things about her personal life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the craziness of this movie. I never expected the 'big climax,' but I did ask myself several times ""will this Barb (HH) chick back the **** off?!""  On to the climax:it was actually a surprise, but what blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for Stacy...after she humiliated all those people. I never got the impression that the bf (Derrick) was cheating on her, yet that tacky talk show would have made you think different.  The ONLY reason he pissed me off was because he didn't read STacy the riot act in the end.This movie tries to wax philosophical, and you just end up hating all of the characters...except for the dog.  A very passible movie.  I wouldn't even bother."	0
I can't believe that no one else has reviewed this dvd. take advantage of the low price and BUY THIS NOW! i'm no expert on the HOT ROD scene, but this was very enjoyable. The footage of pinstripe artist SKRATCH is worth the price alone.    I would say anyone who is into watching creative people do something artistic and original will really love this. you get to see the creative process of some great project cars, as well as getting into the motivation of some of the builders and car club members. I will definitely be watching this one a few times	1
"""Con Express"" has lots of action in it, which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters. Unfortunately, the action isn't enough, and in between stunt pieces and shoot-outs, the audience is tempted to doze off. City Heat Productions isn't really known for producing films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals. The film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2, Con Air, Spy Game, and Speed. If you liked those, you probably won't mind this one too much. Just go easy on it"	0
I did not like this DVD at all.  It requires too many props such as bricks, belts, towels, blankets, chairs, etc... Each pose takes too long due to lengthy explanations.  As a beginner I find this too boring and studio based and unable keep my attention.  I feel it was a waste of money and don't recommend it	0
Let's face it, Tinseltown has run out of original story lines. That's usually when they turn to remakes. I've seen several remakes over the years, both TV and movie, but this is one of the best remakes I've seen in quite some time. I really enjoyed how they expanded on the original story line. What a lot of people need to understand is that this movie had nothing to do with the TV show and pulled all of it's story from the comic book. If you were never into comics to begin with then you can't appreciate the story line. Another thing that I feel is under appreciated about this movie is the CGI. People have to understand that if they got some body builder and slapped green paint on him than the movie would have been a complete waste of time! The amount of man hours that went in to creating the CGI is something to be applauded and appreciated, not mocked and thrown out with the trash. You have to appreciate the movie for the story line and its artistic value. Most people were upset with this movie because they thought it was too slow and it should have been more fun and had a lot more action in it.The story of the Hulk is a sad, depressing, dramatic story! There isn't anything funny about being zapped with radiation and transforming into a mindless brute evertime you get ticked off about something.The Hulk wasn't meant to be campy, it was meant to be serious. My only gripe about this movie is that they could have picked a better actress to play Banner's love interest. The little amount of screen time she was given was completely wasted	1
They SUCK! Bad writing and jokes that rely on gimmicks and previously established Chapelle humor. It was like watching Mind of Mencia. Two thumbs down, leave this one alone. Tupac playing in the club was pretty funny though	0
"If there is one thing Michael Bay is good at, it's explosions.... big 'ol explosions. There are a lot of them in this film, along with a painful-to-watch romantic scene involving animal crackers. This is a film that Ben Affleck & Billy Bob Thornton (both in the film) admit to being ashamed of.Pure ""leave your brain at the door"" entertainment."	0
With King Creole, Love Me Tender and Stay Away Joe - JAILHOUSE ROCK 1957 is Elvis Presley at his best. He declined the old musical tradition of MGM and insisted on a contemparary look - especially how the choreography should be executed.In this film we see ELVIS PRESLEY at his very best. He was a stunning actor - much more prefer HIM to James Dean...  It`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films.... only a handful stands out and JAILHOUSE ROCK is the best.  It isn`t a classic - it isn`t even great. But we have ELVIS - the KING - and that`s the best there is:-))	1
I have probably never seen a movie with quality as bad as this.Even my old tapes from TV were 500% better.  The picture was faded, the characters looked like they were 90 years old and the sound track was off so badly that it also garbled words, so looking away from the movie did not help.  It is also one hour long--but seemed like three-probably a copy of a TV movie as it also had cuts for commercials though I could not find any place that said this. It was advertised as a 2 Hour DVD-and it is--I guess, but I could not see any more of it.  At the end of one hour, it just showed credits and it was over. I am returning it-and it is the first copy of a DVD that I have ever returned for picture and sound quality	0
I got this for my fifth grade class.  It's better than the social studies textbook, but not fun.  I'll probably have to make worksheets to go with it.  Basically a kid reads a history report as a voice-over while the Peanuts kids occasionally do something	0
I am a huge Muppet fan, and was very excited to have the opportunity to get a newer, remastered version of this classic. While the quality is not too much better than the original DVD release, it is definitely worth adding to your collection, especially if you don't have any version of The Movie yet!	1
"Briefly speaking,If you liked Tony Jaa in ""Ong-Bak "" you'll love ""The Protector."" The plots are cut from the same mold (in this movie, Jaa attempts to recover elephants, instead of a statue head, that were stolen from his village by ruthless criminals). The choreography is faster paced and more dynamic (and there's more of it!); once again showcasing Jaa's fantastic martial arts ability.  Since the script and the acting are not on the high end of the cinema achievement scale, the producers were smart to put the emphasis on mindboggling stunts and martial arts choreography.This movie is great. I hope I'm not placing a jinx by saying Tony Jaa is destined to becomea legend. He is the greatest martial artistwe've seen on screen in many years. "	1
This animated perversion of Star Wars is an insult to one of the best Sci-Fi epics of all times. The characters are utterly rediculus (seriously, if the jedi were that actually powerful, why did they need the clones?), there is no plotline to speak of, and the entire thing is badly animated and has crappy voice acting. If you want a good build-up to Episode III, I suggest playing Star Wars: Republic Commando and reading Labyrinth of Evil and the other Clone Wars novels. Don't wast your money on this, it's not worth it	0
"I'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon, due to the utter vileness of this movie.  I saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it, and then a friend purchased the DVD and convinced me to give it a second chance...  all in all, this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that I will never get back.The performances are thin and uneven, the plot is inconsistent, and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of Friends.  To be fair, this movie does face several major obstacles.  It has the misfortune to depend on the ""acting"" of glorified Ken doll Freddie Prinze, Jr. and the vastly overrated Julia Stiles, and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges, it also attempts to survive the intrusion of Ashton Kutcher.  It fails on all counts.  I do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre; nor do I hate the ""teen"" movie sub-genre, under which some would place ""Down to You.""  (In fact, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" is one of my favorite movies.)  I simply hate BAD movies, and this movie is a true abomination.  If you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull, then by all means, buy this DVD.  If, however, you value your sanity, then please do not make the same mistake I did; stay far, FAR away from this movie"	0
Brando can sing!!Guys and Dolls is proof. One of the all time great musicals and the biggest box office hit of 1955, has Brando as the main lead and he is ably supported by THE VOICE - Sinatra. Now only a mad man will say that Brando is a better singer than Sinatra, but to give Brando his due he sang well and carried of the role brilliantly...like wise only a mad man will say Sinatra is a better actor than Brando.Guys and Dolls is a very important film in Brando's career. It is the first light hearted movie he made. All his movies before this were heavy dramatic stuff. This is the first movie where Brando is having fun and what fun it was.Great songs, great acting and great stars...GUYS and DOLLS is 4 star entertainment all the way.Brando and Simmons along with Sinatra and Blaine are amazing. 	1
It is a well made movie based on a great book. I was particularly impressed by the performance of the leading actors Deborah Findley and Ciara'n Hinds. Following their play, you can feel in the whole the deepness and the manifold of the characters	1
I enjoy this genre of film, but found this one dull. It carries a rough smattering of supposedly sentimental and inspiring elements that are intended to create cohesion and a willing suspension of disbelief, but fall short of both aims.  I actually groaned in response to the predictability, and shuttered at the stereotypes, which were mentioned in another review.  At best, stereotypes of ignorant, aggressively dangerous, and perpetually struggling African and Hispanic American students who are lost in the world and can only be saved by a lovable, blue eyed, blonde-haired European American belle with superior life experience and intelligence are offensive.  At worst, these stereotypes are haled as informative and inspiring.  This movie has hit the worst in perpetuating stereotypes as both. Further, it fails to inspire thought or commentary on real racial, societal, and economic issues, which is what this genre of film is usually esteemed for. 	0
"Another tired story about the Blackman as the horrible villian and the Blackwoman as the innocent victim...And we wonder why our community has so many problems..Maybe it's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films...""Color Purple"" , ""For Colored Girls...."" etc. We need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we ""work together""...That means Blackmen and Blackwomen.."	0
Absolutely riveting performance by Noah Taylor as the thirty-year old Adlof Hitler.  The story is very uneven, however, but Taylor is perfect and brings the film up to a must-see five stars.  You are there. 	1
"I read all 33 of the other reviews here to get other perspectives - a lively debate.  There were so many brilliant things said about the film, that I found myself passing out ""Helpful"" votes (to both positive & blisteringly negative reviews) like they were candy.  The movie is an evocative work of art.  I encourage people to read all the reviews if they want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view.  I agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have been made by other reviewers, but I will limit my comments to items not previously mentioned.The DVD cover gives the false impression that this is a love story about two young lovers, a sort of ""Blue Lagoon"" from the Renaissance.  It is not.  It is misleading.I concede a) the story is probably not historically accurate, b) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any definition, & c) Tossi was probably inconsiderate, conceited, and immoral.  But the quality of a film is not judged solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the characters.  Having said that, I do object that the movie, according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best evidence available, is not just inaccurate, but oppositional to what probably occurred.  Therefore, I critique the film for portraying itself as the story of a real person.  The movie stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical effects with fictional (or incorrect) causal factors.  And those cause-effect relationships don't seem to ring true.Having said that, I agree with some of Richard Burt's review comments that ""historical accuracy"" may still be subject to interpretation.  It is reasonable that Artemisia may have been more adversarial speaking in a public rape trial (defending her freedom and reputation) than she might have been with Tassi personally.  And it seems too easy to just paint Tassi as a purely evil character as other reviewers have done.  There is usually more complexity and diverse/conflicting interests in most people, especially artists.One strong objection - near the end of the film, Artemisia says, ""No one dies of sorrow.""  While there is probably some intended sarcasm in the comment, the line frustrated me.  People DO die of sorrow.  My limited experience has suggested that some of the smartest, most sensitive, artistic, and caring people I've encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow.  And the people I have admired the most are the same people who have been mortally threatened by sorrow.  Not selfish, controlling, or passive-aggressive sorrow, but rather sorrow that comes from other less obvious motivations - often unidentified & misunderstood misconceptions.  Sorrow can lead to literal death and deaths of the spirit, character, the soul, & creativity.  Sorrow is not incidental.  Sorrow can destroy health.  Or as the Angel of America in ""Angels in America"" says, ""The body is the garden of the soul.""  Sorrow is worth full attention.The movie tries to examine the effect of Artemisia's loyalties to her father and her teacher.  The screenwriter is not bent on us assessing those relationships as simply ""good"" or ""bad""; both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad effects on Artemesia.  Her loyalties encourage her artistry and her expression.  They work to create an environment that does not inhibit or conceal her gifts.  At the same time, they are so intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices, privacy, and pacing beyond her desired level of influence.Artemisia realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except for her father's drive and design.  At the same time, she also laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations she could participate in - in polite society.May your loyalties encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can find.  And may the best personal truths you can find shape your loyalties.Compare Caravaggio's ""Judith Beheading Holofernes"" to Artemisia's version of the same painting.  Her version is more violent, realistic (less idealized in posing, dirtiness, lighting, etc.).  Her version has the female servant actively helping Judith.  Artemisia's paintings show a palpable understanding of hate, violence, sexuality & compassion.  Artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and experiences she knew best.  That's why people care about whether a movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately - because we want to know what led her to her creative decisions"	0
"Release the bats is definatly one of my favorite dvds i own. It will show you a side of pete wentz and others you may or may not want to see... i thought it was very interesting to see and its kind of cool to see another side others may not have. You also get to find out who Dirty is or whatever. Pete says things about him in a couple of places (online) and all i could think is ""who is that?"" so thats also very exciting. I would say as long as you have a good sense of humor your pretty much safe buying this.remember: its the stuff deemed 'unfit' for ""my heart with always be the b-side to my tongue"	1
"This is a film like none other you have ever seen, and as such you'll either love it, or hate it.From the ""reviews"" posted on Amazon, I've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who don't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it.This film is not literal.  Learn to *think* about what you are watching.  To interpret archetypes, symbolism and metaphor.A clue: the Lady character is named STORY.  Now why might that be?And why would she require a VESSEL before taking flight into the world?And what precisely does the wolf-like Scrunt represent?And why are there THREE of those monkeys?This film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world.  If you aren't an artist, you probably won't get it at all, and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this.  But that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says, and love every beautiful, unique and visionary second of it.Magical."	1
There can't be a better storyteller than Teddy Ruxpin. As I child I was enthralled with this animated story and would impatiently play with my toy Teddy Ruxpin as I waited for Saturday morning to come again so I could see another episode of the TV series. This show has a clear progression of plot development that starts right from episode one. So many cartoons are just one-shots, an individual small plot for each episode. Teddy Ruxpin was an epic adventure that caught you up and carried you along for a fantastic adventure! Along the way, kids learn important morals, values, and a lot about their own world. This is a fantastic cartoon to share with children of any age. And what a great price! Well worth it!	1
It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available full season box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available. C'mon WB, we love these shows and will pay for them. We only ask that you don't rape our wallets. Give us the full season box sets much sooner	0
"I really didn't enjoy the movie, but  I had to finish it.  The hypocrisy of Faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the so-called fundamentalist that I know, but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying.  This movie presented a very perverted view of Christianity.  Though there was alot of talking about Jesus and saying His name, it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually KNEW HIM and spent time with Him.  When Mary gets a revelation from something she believes is Christ that opposed the actual Word of God, she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision.  Christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against His Word.  No one actually reads a Bible in the movie.  Consequently, most made many life-damaging decisions.  I hated the ""reality"" of the movie, but it has challenged me to actually spend time with Christ and learn about Him. I shudder to think that I could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what Christianity truly is. "	0

"I couldn't watch this till the end. Bad production values, gimmicky, desperate to make a point about violence and voyeurism and evil and wanting to make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide from the nnui. If you wanna go all deep thoughts on violence and still get shaken - both intelectually and viscerally - try something like Miike's ""Ichi the Killer"". Makes this movie look so, so needless.The leading man looked geeky and occasionally cute. 2 stars for the eye candy"	0

"""Rip It Off"" is not an easy film to watch. In short, it is dull and meanders from plot line to plot line, leaving only the most attentive viewer (read: myself) to guess at what was going to happen next. But not in a good way. Judging from its drab look and unimaginatively shot scenes, not to mention a script whose dialogue borders on the absurd, it never ceases to amaze me how it managed to attract such well-known and talented personalities as Alyson Hannigan and Jennifer Esposito. It begs the question: WHY DID YOU DO THIS FILM? Or, on a personal note, why did I BUY this film, especially at $22 and change? Frankly, I bought it because of Alyson Hannigan: she's gorgeous, obviously intelligent, and the girl can act. Individually speaking, she does not disappoint here. It's obvious that she really didn't want to sleep walk through her role as Lexi, and she gives the other actors a lot of material to work with. Although the silly musical leitmotifs seem deliberately crafted to undermine her scenes, she is a singularly interesting actor to watch, and her performance simply wants me to see her do more, preferably a more mature and fully fleshed out character in a serious film (see Jennifer Aniston in her brave performance in ""The Good Girl."")But enough gushing: if Ms. Hannigan had not been as engaged, I would have trashed her soundly. Most everyone else in ""Rip It Off"" (with the possible exception of the fellow who plays Sergei with operatic relish) is more or less ""phoning it in"" when they do their scenes. This made me lack any kind of sympathy for them in addition to making me sleepy. Also, films of such low production value should come with a printed warning of some sort: BEWARE! DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SCREEN; THE APPEARANCE OF THE FILM IS INHERENTLY BAD. ""Rip It Off"" and films of its ilk give independent filmmaking a black eye. I've seen black and white student films with greater intrigue and atmosphere than this turkey. And, contrary to the technical description of the DVD, IT IS PRESENTED IN THE HORROR THAT IS FULL SCREEN, AND NOT WIDESCREEN. Can you believe people invest money in these films? (Ahem."	0
this is definately worth the price.  i cried and laughed watching the perfect story of chi and hedeki.  beautiful animation, great story line	1
THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Wes Anderson's third major motion picture.  The movie revolves around a rich, but extremely eccentric man name Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman).  Royal and his wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) had three children:  Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson).  In the 1970s the Tenenbaums were one of America's premier families:  Margot was a famous playwright, Richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive U.S. Nationals, and Chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen.  That was almost thirty years ago and the Tenenbaums have largely been forgotten.  Betrayal, failure, and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died.  What's worse is that Royal's children and wife blame him for all their failures.  Royal senses that his time is Earth is waning and he wishes to set things right.  With the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend, Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family's eyes.I'm a pretty big fan of Wes Anderson and have seen all four of his films.  THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Anderson's most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture.  However, it is my least favorite of his movies.  Like all Anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue.  The film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family, a theme that I enjoy.  Yet, the film just didn't resonate with me as much as Anderson's other pictures.  I really don't know why that is.  That's not to say THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is a bad movie because it's not.  In addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting, brilliant set designs, etc.  I just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a sea-voyaging documentarian instead	1
Okay, I gave a pretty bad review of this dvd originally because it didn't play right.  But after viewing it without the technical problems, I would like to say that it is a pretty good program and given the rarity of the subject matter, a good addition to any collection.  Ancient muscle conditioning?  Not many dvd's out there on the subject.  I've edited my original review and it won't allow me to give it more stars, but I'd give it 4.  Sorry, Mr. Keen, if I cost you sales on this.  I commend you for putting this out	0
I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Richard Jeni live a few years ago and I gotta tell you that I really almost peed my pants. He was astoundingly funny. This DVD definitely captures his comic genius, although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed.It was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which, from what I heard, was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get, which is itself really sad. He developed what I think is the best comedy, which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are, ultimately, pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world.He will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do...and by doing so, how we should and can be a lot better than we are	1
"I was very disappointed with this film. The premise was really intriguing, with Elvis switching places with an Elvis impersonator who as we all know goes on to die at Graceland leaving the real Elvis to scratch out a living as - what else - an Elvis ""impersonator."" And now, at the end of The King's life, he's a semi-invalid in a nursing home being attacked by a killer zombie mummy. Since it's Texas, the mummy has a more than passing resemblance to Stevie Ray Vaughn. And oh, yeah, JFK is also in this nursing home, having inexplicably been transformed into Ozzie Davis.How can you miss with a setup like this? Well, for starters by assuming the premise is so funny there's no real need to provide any additional comedy. The movie is flat, with very little humor. As other reviewers have noted, it moves at a glacial pace, even allowing for the protagonists being 80-somethings who don't move like they used to.Sure, the acting is several notches above the norm for a low budget film, but there's no point in making a comdey that isn't funny.Nice try, but booooooooooring. Not at all recommended."	0
"""The Talons of Weng Chiang"" is a wonderfully creepy pseudo-historical tale full of mood, atmosphere, and an unusual amount of violence for ""Doctor Who""--almost as if departing producer Philip Hinchcliffe was taking a parting shot at his critics on his way out. But it's not all gloom and doom. This storyline is a fine mix indeed of good old ""Doctor Who"" humor at its funniest as well as thrilling ""Doctor Who"" adventure at its most gruesome. The dank and dour city streets and slums of late-19th century London make a grim backdrop for a tale of manipulation, madness, and serial murder (technologically refined cannibalism, really), and yet the Doctor's many clever quips and Leela's naively astute observations on ""civilized"" Victorian life keeps the viewer laughing throughout, and the main villain's second-hand man, Li-Hsen Chang, has some incredibly witty one-liners as well.Li-Hsen Chang himself is a fascinating character, delightfully entertaining on stage and yet cold and ruthless in his service to ""Weng-Chiang,"" a stranded, time-traveling dictator from the future who has deceived Chang into believing he's a deity from the Taoist pantheon. Chang's paranormal powers, foremost of which is hypnotism, definitely evoke the late Victorian fascination with mesmerism (see the poster advertising his show) and serve to mark him as a clever echo of the evil Fu Manchu characters so much the stock villains of pulp fiction, and yet he's also a tragic figure in many ways--a healthy, innocent rural farmer whose simple religious beliefs were abused by an evil man--uprooted and given extraordinary powers along with refinement and authority by his ""god"" and yet irrevocably corrupted in the process. In many ways this works as a dark counterpoint to the Pygmalion-style educational program the Doctor's putting Leela through, to her annoyance.If Li-Hsen Chang is an interesting and complex adversary though, the same can't really be said for his master, Weng-Chiang himself. He's a rather unremarkable two-dimensional villain, I'm afraid, complete with hokey bad-guy laugh and over-the-top acting. Perhaps the writers were going for a sort of campy effect, but if so, they overdid it just a bit. At times too he's just more annoying than frightening--every time the ever loyal Li-Hsen is faithfully going about their nefarious business only to be thwarted by the Doctor, Weng-Chiang throws a fit, savagely berating the poor guy on and on ad nauseum. On this score, Weng-Chiang is less evil incarnate than a bad reminder of some dysfunctional manager at one's workplace. It doesn't help either that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the clean-cut bureaucratic deity of education whom he's presumably impersonating, so that the whole idea comes across as altogether somewhat unconvincing.All in all, though, this is an enjoyable adventure. The Doctor is at his sleuthing best, Leela shines as a displaced neolithic warrior, and a fine complement of vividly memorable supporting characters keep the story moving right along in an entertaining fashion, all of them brought to life by a fine script and even finer acting. And anyway, Li-Hsen more than makes up for Weng-Chiang's deficiencies as an interesting villain for most of the show, while the cyborg assassin Mr. Sin is genuinely creepy (especially if you have a phobia of ventriloquist dolls). So this is a fine storyline altogether as long as you take some of it with a grain of salt--or a dash of soy sauce, rather"	1
"I was expecting to see a decent film by Bava, but after having seen about 5 of his films, I can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us. Most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story, this film is just like all the rest. There is no point to any of it, there is no plot and hardly any suspense, suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult, its quite tedious. Chris Lee is rather banal also, he doesn't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio, most of the cast is rather dull also, supposedly playing some ancient noble family, they look more like 1960's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid. The dialogue, what there is, is crude, probably written by a drunk Italian because there are so many mistakes, one example was when Lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says, ""I can't have more ice cream!"" So, I would suggest renting ""Planet of the Vampires"" because that is more enjoyable than this waste. Interesting character to note was ""Lesmo"", dubbed as the ""European Peter Lorre"" who doesn't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget.

Way too expensive for a low quality product.  The clarity of the picture is poor.  There is not enough content to justify the price.  I don't recommend it at all.  I feel I've been cheated	0
It's not a conflict of good and evil that drives MILLIONS (Fox), but rather issues of what's right and wrong.Set in the UK, this exquisite family film about two brothers, serious seven year old Damien and fun-loving nine year Anthony, who recently lost their mom and discover a suitcase full of British Pounds has dropped out of the sky and crashed into their playhouse.  And it's only seven days before the official currency switches to Euros.  The brothers think it came from God and they have differing agendas: Spend it on themselves or give it to the needy.  But the money, on a train to incinerators, was tossed by crooks to accomplices and they want the missing bag back. Millions is funny, scary and profound.  You may even discover things about yourself you never before considered. Rated: PG.  Genre: Family Drama/Comedy.  1 Hour, 38 Minutes.  Starring: James Nesbitt, Daisy Donovan, Alex Etel, Lewis McGibbon.  Director: Danny Boyle. 	1

I loved these guys as a kid. This collection sucks!!! Don't BUY It! The first 3 DVD's are silent and the 5th DVD is a reunion show. The grand total for shows you can actually watch is 4. Take your time and search out the specific shows and characters you love and get them individually. If I could get my money back I would RUN to the nearest post office and return this item ASAP!!	0
Outstanding!  I new a remastered version of Ran was a must have, but I did not expect to enjoy Madadayo as much as I did.  While I agree the packaging does not protect the disks well, I got lucky and had no damage.  I wonder how they will handle this issue if they truly only made 5,000	1
I'm a huge Orson Welles fan and actually regret making this public knowledge - but I hated this film. I was excited to crack open the beautiful packaging and quickly fell into a disappointing episode of feeling really dumb that I just didn't get it. The photography was classic Welles - the acting was something out of a bad rehersal at an insane asylum. Don't get caught up in having to like it, just because it's Welles - it's ok to go against the grain and declare to the world - this movie blows	0
This movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made.  I use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies.  They are either worse than this one (rare) or better than this one. As an example: Buffalo '66 is worse.  If you watch both in the same day, you will surely die	0
Julia plays a struggling mother trying to make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a Giant Corporation in a Court Of Law.Julia manages to extract a lot of information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the benefits of a Wonderbra but that is just about all that this movie has going for it. I give this film 5 stars because Julia does look pretty attractive in it at most times	1
"After watching ""Harsh Times"" we wondered ""Is this a comedy or are they just mocking inner city life?"" we couldn't believe what we were watching. It was meant to be the new 2006 version of ""Training Day""--they even got Christian Bale to play the lead role--but only in the eyes of the people involved in it. It was a miscalculation and we'll explain why.Brief Story:The movie takes place mostly in the dangerous inner city streets of L.A. Jim Davis (Christian Bale) is a mentally unstable young Iraq War veteran. Now in the States, he is looking for a job as a cop. Jim's best friend Mike Alonzo (Freddy Rodrguez) is also unemployed, but when his friend comes to visit, they prefer to hang out and commit all kinds of illegal activities--selling drugs, guns, getting high just to name few. To spend time with his friend, Mike has to lie to his girlfriend Sylvia (Eva Longoria) making her believe that he is looking for a job. She doesn't know the world of crime they are involved in and the terrible consequences they might face.Review:""Harsh Times"" has many problems, but the most notorious one is the crime ""video game"" feeling it has throughout the film. The characters and situations are so unbelievable that the whole thing feels like watching a ""Grand Theft Auto"" or ""Scarface: The World Is Yours"" video game adaptation with a little bit of ""Cheech & Chong"" in the mix. There is no climax--we just see them driving to different places, arguing among themselves and committing all kinds of crimes without anything conclusive until the very end. Christian Bale's accent in this movie doesn't help either, not only it changes through out the film, but we are not sure what kind of accent he is trying to emulate. The dialogue between the two friends feels forced and teenager-like--also there is no chemistry between them. The acting in this movie is disappointing, especially from Bale who we liked in movies like ""American Psycho"", ""Batman Returns"" and ""The Prestige."" It is clear that he was miscast this time. He just cannot do what Denzel Washington did in ""Training Day."" Because of his accent and terrible acting in this film, we believe this is his worst performance to date. This is something he doesn't want to add to his resume.The Verdict:Christian Bale Returns, but this new American Psycho cannot find his Equilibrium. ""Harsh Times"" tries too hard to create the edgy, dramatic style of the dangerous inner city life that ""Training Day"" had, but it doesn't even come close to achieve that goal. We laugh at the silliness of the story, overdramatic acting and Christian Bale whose fake accent in this film has to be the worst of the year. He probably thought he was going to get nominated for best actor. This is a miscalculation of great proportions by him and his agent."	0
This movie is really cute. Fluffy and not too deep but really funny. Meg Ryan is in rare form. I love the scene at the sidewalk cafe	1
I would love to review this Lions Gate DVD, but I can't catch one word in ten.  It is NOT, as advertised, closed-captioned, and the characters' speech is too casual and British for me to get.  Drat! -- I was so chuffed to see there was a cc version	0
"""Midway"" was the decisive naval engagement of the Second World War -- decided by a handful of bombs hitting the Japanese carriers over a period of a few minutes.  It is a riveting story that has been well told in several movies and innumerable books.  Not here.  Relying upon outtakes from ""Tora Tora Tora"" (and the wonderful Japanese cast of that film) what we have here is a pedestrian outing that should be avoided at all costs.  Quite honestly?

I saw this at a friends house--so thank God I didn't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy.  I can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film!

In sanskrit, Ayurveda means the study of life. According to ancient Hindu texts, all healing systems stem from Ayurvedic medicine. This Ancient Ayurveda series dvd, led by Sarah Tomlinson with clarity and insight, provides a blueprint for increasing self-awareness through the use of asana, symbol and metaphor. Tomlinson, acts like a loving guide to going inward and discovering new self-truths. To effectively bring about change in our bodies and minds, we must change habitual patterns in the body. The poses in the series takes us through a full range of challenging movements, and Tomlinson illuminates the wisdom of this practice by brilliantly threading together how the poses evoke certain states of mind and spirit. Filmed against a simple, soothing background, Tomlinson wisely avoids distracting bells and whistles. Instead, the accompanying chanting by ayurveda master Gandharva,directly relates to the series in it's use of each of the planetary mantras. Tomlinson's has a great depth of knowledge about ayurveda, and she weaves many subtle suggestions and information about the benefits of each pose into the practice. This dvd is appropriate for beginner and advanced student: beginners will feel supported and encouraged, as well as exhilirated by the practice, and more experienced students will appreciate the multi-level aspect of Tomlinson's class.L. Landau, teacher and student	1
"What really good fun!! My whole family enjoyed these Dvds to the fullest.  Really wonderful, with the feeling of Rome and a personalized view of the history.  We often travel to Italy and this was a ""taste"" without the trip"	1
Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one	0
This DVD skips quite a bit, making it hard to relax for what should be an enjoyable movie.  Also, the plastic covering on the DVD casewas torn a little bit when the security sticker was taken off.  I've never had a movie do that before.  I would think twice in the future before buying movies from Amazon.com	0
'Fais-moi des vacances' (WE NEED A VACATION) is a finely wrought little film that studies the disparities between the classes in France while introducing us to a warmly tender and humorous friendship between two young lads.  Directed and written by Didier Bivel (with writing assistance from Djamila Djabri) it offers a slice of life we rarely see - that underbelly of France's projects where mixed races strive to exist without the amenities of those with means who surround their neighborhoods.Lucien (Aymen Sadi) lives with his father (Bernard Blancan), mother (Hiam Abbass), young sister Pamela (Laura Mas Navarro), and his tough streetwise older brother Jos (Nabil El Bouhairi) in a small flat.  Close by is his African friend Adama (Ibrahim Koma) and his equally poor family of father (Makan Fofana), mother (Marie-Philomne Nga) and sister Fanta (Hawa Yakar Sissoko).  As school ends the kids whose families have money take them on a vacation, a state neither Lucien nor Adama can afford despite their obsession with that luxury.  The two boys manipulate funds and ideas and ultimately come up with the idea of secretly jumping aboard a RUV of a family headed for the beach.  BUT despite the success of their plan and the encouragement of the daughter of the van's owners, the boys end up not at the beach but at a nudist camp, a fact that makes them flee!  Upon returning home both boys' families punish their activities and when Lucien seeks comfort from his older brother, Jos beats him and tells him to grow up.  In the end the boys finagle their way to the beach, but of course by this time vacation time is over and they are on an empty beach re-evaluating their lives.The cast is uniformly strong, the writing is excellent, and the camera work not only captures the claustrophobia of the projects but also opens up the vistas of the boys' imaginations.  It is a fine little film, one deserving of a wide audience.  Grady Harp, January 07 	1
Paycheck is a disappointing and sometimes frustrating film because it clumsily toys with a number of potentially brilliant ideas without really knowing what to do with them. These key concepts come courtesy of Philip K. Dick, via his original short story, though the film poorly represents the themes and conceits that have made his stories into unforgettable classics.  As a thriller, Paycheck depends upon our identification with its imperiled hero, but the movie is never able to make us truly care about Ben Affleck's Michael Jennings or his fragile state of mind, and that's something Dick would have found unforgivable. Only Uma Thurman really earns her paycheck here. The premise is high concept, and the prophetic threat is revealed to be of apocalyptic proportion, but Paycheck is never more than a pedestrian action film spun from chains of meaningless chase sequences and flat fight scenes. The future world created by John Woo isn't nearly as engaging or convincing as, say, the captivating science fiction setting crafted by Stephen Spielberg for another high-profile Dick adaptation, Minority Report. For Paycheck, the comparison is not flattering. Sadly, Woo can't even keep himself from forcing his own creative preoccupations into the film, and a resulting motorcycle chase sequence is outright uninspired and may represent the film's low. Some scenes are enjoyable, and there are fleeting flashes of wit and excitement, but much of what unfolds seems inappropriately conceived or placed. Paycheck isn't a smart film and, what's more, it sometimes assumes that its audience isn't even paying attention. As a result, the film never comes close to living up to its potential. The material and the audience deserve better. Unfortunately, Paycheck is forgettable fare and, truly, it is without any real payoff.--Brian A. DixonRevelation Magazin	0
"Following the series of Firefly, Serenity continues the story line for a few  more steps.  There are so many ways this movie is packed I cannot begin to properly mention them here.  The storyline is woven to present images not so much out of sequence but in a ""solving the mystery"" approach.  The english language used presents a plausible development that on first viewing is not difficult to follow or understand- mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing.  The animations are first rate and contribute to an unbelievably real quality.  The characters are complex, focused, solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations.  The challenges the crew of Serenity face are many: from their interactions with unsavory underworld bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority ""Alliance"" forces to the overt mortal threat of the ""Reavers"".  The climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue.  The music in Serenity contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more.  I suggest seeing the series Firefly before watching the movie Serenity to fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters"	1
I was thinking about purchasing all four of these movies, but to have them together in a box set is a beautiful thing.

Made in 1959, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago. It's a real cinematic treat, shameless tearjerker, and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one's teenagers - in this case daughters--are growing up and preparing to enter the world.Lana Turner has never looked more ravishing as Lora Meredith, a young New York widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of Broadway stardom. Together with her young daughter Susie, they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence, their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams. One day at Coney Island, Lora and Susie meet another a white girl Sarah Jane, who is being taken care of by a black woman, Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), whom Lora mistakes for the maid.  When told by her that she's the mother, the surprised Lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child. The angelic and virtuous Annie asks Lora if she can come and help out around the apartment. Lora is initially hesitant - not because of Annie's race but because she's struggling and doesn't have any money to pay her a wage. Eventually, however, she relents and tells Annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night. At the same time, Lora meets the extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer, Steve Archer (John Gavin). Steve takes an instant liking to Lora and offers to marry her. But Lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage. Meanwhile, the saintly Annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white.Imitation of Life follows these characters throughout their lives, with Sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get.  Lora does indeed become a famous Broadway actress, yet neglects her growing daughter in the process. Steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization, but has trouble relating to Lora's need to be independent and famous. Annie's heart is eventually broken, gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter. Sara Jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away. Annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success. The contrast of the mother's compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story's ultimate paradox.Lora, Annie, Steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other. They all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn't seem to be doing them much good. They are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them. Lora gets her career but she's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother, Whilst Sara Jane - perhaps the most damaged character - achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl, but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother. Under Douglas Sirk's accomplished direction, Miss Turner et al acts ornately and elaborately, everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life, especially Lana's gorgeous outfits, yet the film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and is never boring. The screenplay is sophisticated, the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant surfaces, audacious colors, and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy, entrapment, and emotional anxiety, and where the price of following one's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost.

"SCRUBS has been a model of consistency in its five seasons--and to interrupt myself, why aren't we anticipating Season Five instead of Season Four? And boo! on them for being so slow to bring the show out on DVD!--and Season Four is no exception. I recently rewatched Seasons 1 through 3 on DVD with my daughter and it really brought home just how great this series has been from the very beginning to the present. If you visit boards there are always prognosticators who declare that it isn't as good as it used to be, but I would be dishonest if I said that I detected any decline. One thing I've really enjoyed is that unlike situation comedies, this one really does have an overall story arc, and I really appreciate Bill Lawrence and Co. taking the time to reward fans of the show in this way. The story in Season Four revolves largely around the very, very gradual repair of the friendship between JD and Elliott. Fans of the show know that at the end of Season Three JD, utterly smitten by Elliott, had expressed his love for her, causing her to break off her relationship with her boyfriend to be with JD. No sooner had he done this, however, he once again felt trapped and almost immediately broke things off with her. Season Four opens with her filled with hatred of him, complicated by the fact that she and he are named co-chief residents (though there is wonderful confusion over the fact that the name plate on her door reads--thanks to Janitor--""Chief Resident"" and his misleadingly reads ""Co-Chief Resident,"" causing many to imagine that she is over him). Some of my favorite visuals in the series are of JD and Elliott wedged into their ultra tiny office, barely large enough for the desk they face each other across. Of course, eventually they patch things up, but for the first season have no kind of romantic entanglement. Given the intensity of the events of the ends of Season Three, any sort of getting together would certainly have ended with Elliott murdering JD. The season ends with Carla and Turk urging JD to move out and get a place of his own, which leads to an interesting roommate situation in Season Five. Season Four continued the SCRUBS tradition of having some very high profile guest stars. This was marred somewhat by having the absolutely dreadful Colin Farrell on one episode, an episode through which he drifted as if completely drunk or totally bored (there have been very few bad episodes of SCRUBS, but this episode ranks near the bottom). The always delightful Heather Graham sparkled through several episodes earlier in the season. Matthew Perry stopped by for an episode less interesting for his presence than for his being teamed with his father, Jonathan Bennett Perry, a country singer best known to most people as the Old Spice sailor. Tara Reid puts in another appearance as JD's terrible sometimes girlfriend while Molly Shannon is in another episode. And Julianna Margulies of ER appears in a couple of episodes. The great tragedy with SCRUBS is that it remains something of a secret. The only comedy better than SCRUBS in the past few years has been ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT (most fans of one show tend to be a fan of the other as well, and the lead of each show appeared on the other, Zach Braff as the producer of the GIRLS WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM series of videos on AR and Jason Bateman as a patient on SCRUBS) and while it won a large number of awards, its ratings were worse than SCRUBS. This show has decent ratings, but shockingly few awards. How terrible shows like EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND and the formerly good but now dull WILL AND GRACE beat it out for awards is mystifying. And how did it manage only one Emmy nomination? It was nominated for Best Comedy Series, but why wasn't Zach Braff nominated for Best Comic Actor and John C. McGinley and Donald Faison for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and Sarah Chalke for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series? How is that possible? Much ink has been spilt on how the 2006 Emmy nominations have made less sense than any in memory (Lauren Graham yet again not nominated, though clearly the best comic actress on TV for at least five years and five vastly less talented women were nominated instead of her; LOST not nominated; no nominations for VERONICA MARS; Jason Lee not nominated for MY NAME IS EARL; neither Michael Chiklis, Hugh Laurie, nor James Gandolofini nominated for Best Actor, while Martin Sheen who was barely appeared in this year's WEST WING; while shows way, way, way, way past their prime like WILL AND GRACE and THE WEST WING nominated; and the list goes on) but Zach Braff's failure to be nominated while Charlie Sheen and Kevin James did is just one more reason not to take the Emmys seriously at all. At least the Golden Globes more or else get it right. Anyway, awards aside, and armed with the knowledge that the best shows are usually neglected by the Emmys (how many Emmy nods did BUFFY get despite most of the nation's best TV critics passionately begging each year for it to get the recognition it deserved), fans of the show will be delighted with Season Four and if you aren't a fan, you should be. But don't start with Season Four. Go back and do it right. Either buy or rent (I recommend buying--you'll want to watch this more than once) Season One, then work your way forward. Many pleasurable hours will result"	1
I really enjoyed Goodbye Lenin, and it was mostly on the basis of seeing thatm film that I decided to watch this one. The film follows three idealistic, politically right-on young people rebelling against what they see as unthinking, selfish and uncaring Bourgeois consumer society. This rebellion takes the form of breaking into rich peoples houses, moving their furniture around, and leaving notes like 'You are too wealthy' - very situationist (never mind the fact that this point is probably largely lost on the rich people they break into).All this is fine and well, but the problem with the film is that on the one hand it glamourises these young people, and on the other paints every single other person in the film as some rich, ignorant Bourgeois pig. In the first ten minutes or so, I thought this might be a clever bit of directing, in which we view society as seen through their eyes, rather than society in its reality. However, this wasn't to be the case. The world remained Bourgeois, the kids are alright. The older generation Bourgeoise are bare cyphers, and none (with the exception of the man they kidnap) is given anything like a personality. When a break-in goes wrong and they have to kidnap the rich man who lives there, and take him away to a shack in the hills. During this time, they decide to 'educate' him about the wrongs of the world and the rich man's part in them. The rich man barely challenges the young people at all, and accepts much of what he has done is probably wrong. The anti-capitalist argument running through the entire film is very one-sided. I could appreciate the film a little bit more if it was balanced, but this wasn't. Furthermore, there are all the usual cliches associated with this type of work - the Edukators are young, good-looking and artistic - the subtext being that because they are arty, they can see things that others can't. At one point, one of the characters is on a bus when three men (presumably police, though its not made clear) hassle a drunk for not having a ticket. The character angrily bursts in and tells them to leave the drunk alone, gives the drunk his ticket, and gets off the bus. Do drunks even get hassled on buses by gangs of police? Can't say that's my experience - amybe they do in Germany. This is a recurring problem with the film - situations designed to show the main characters in a good light are contrived and unrealstic.The anarchist/marxist/anti-capitalist dialouge the characters preach is so generic that it actually ends up being meaningless - by the end of the film you don't actually know what exactly they stand for, or what their solutions are to the problems of society. Basically, the one-sided political argument hamstrings the characters development. Their views are never challenged, so they don't change. It is left to the kidnapping and love triangle to create the conflict in the film. The ending is also unbeleivably cynical, and completely undoes any idealism that had been generated in the course of the film.Generally, it feels like a script written by a 1st year politics student, being so utterly simplistic in it's 'the Rich are all bad' message. I would recommend this to anyone who is 17 years old and angry at society, but at the same time I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wanted some insight into how we should solve the world's problems. There has been a rash of good political films lately - Good Night and Good Luck, Syriana, The Constant Gardener. Unfortunately, and given so much potential, this film is not one of them. Shame	0
"This movie is intimate and special. Some reviews say it is the story of obsession, of fetishism, of trivial things. However, this movie is the story of something special in a young teenage boy's life: his fantasy woman.    The character Malena rarely speaks throughout the movie, but we see her exactly how we are supposed to see her- through the eyes of an old man telling the story of himself in young ""love"". This perspective makes her ideal and special, with few flaws,as a fantasy woman is to a young man. Malena is instantly a likeable character, not awful and disgusting like those using her.    We cannot forget that our narrator, Renato, is not actually a teenage boy but an older man telling his own story. Therefore, he is unreliable as a narrator. Malena's sins are washed clean through his judgement, and we believe him when we see her victimized by the other women. However, Renato has had years to think about everything, to contemplate what really happened to her. So, in the end, the people who use her are completely despicable, unable to garner any liking.    Of course, she is a victim, but she eventually falls into the gossip that others believe she is guilty of with the men. The movie does offer a hint that she could have escaped all of the problems: she is from another city and her husband, for most of the movie, is dead. Yet, she chooses to not escape but to stay, and her fate is sealed.    The music in the movie was nominated for Best Score in 2000,and it is beautiful, emotional. It truly adds to the feeling of the movie.     I would recommend this movie to anyone for the compelling story, emotion, and characters. You will never forget this movie."	1
This film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times.  It is not comparable to other great Westerns made during the sixties.  Eli Wallach is good but confusing--who and what is he after?   The color is good and it sounds like a Sergo Leone picure but it isn't.  What a shame!!!  It could have been made better--less comedy and more plot and of course --action and suspense!!!!  Buy or rent on your own if you dare----I wouldn't	0
My 2 yr old daughter has been watching the Einstein movies (baby&little) since she was born. We just got this and the second she saw it come in the mail she was running around the house excited, not able to wait for her 5 yr old brother to get home to watch it. She has all the Little Eistein movies except for the one that has the ones from the tv show. She watches them almost everyday and loves when she gets a new one. These are great movies for little kids to learn. She has be larger vocabulary then most 2 yr olds. Little Einstein is a great way for children to learn about a variety of things before they start school.	1
"The Truth About Cats and Dogs is a thoroughly enjoyable, refreshing movie. Janeane Garofalo uses her bread and butter acting technique of playing a cynical, depressed, miserable, pessimistic character who sees herself as an ugly duckling who no man could want. Of course, she's not really acting. That's really her: lock, stock, and barrel. The miserable, pessimistic, vicious act isn't an act at all.The fly in the ointment to this movie is that Uma Thurman is not a knockout. Of course, some men would prefer the tall, thin blonde over the short brunette, but the basis of the movie hinges on Uma being the gorgeous woman and Janeane being average. But it doesn't work when you believe it's the other way around. Uma Thurman has certainly looked good in some movies, but she looks haggard here.Bottom Line: A good film about the ""ugly duckling"" getting the guy. Based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac story, just like Roxanne starring Steve Martin"	1

I loved this movie...it was a little hard to follow because of the commercial break timings in it.

The Fridays gang steals some diamonds.  Mike Epps is not Chris Tucker no matter how hard he tries to be.  His constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve.

I bought this DVD to replace a worn Video from the BBC(British Broadcasting Commission). It was a bit of a shock. The original film has been edited and chopped up with bits of rubbish added through. It also now has a poor voice over. The whole feel of the film has been removed. All the PBS...and viewers like your rubbish? Where'd that come from. It was totallly funded via the BBC. The PBS editions mess up may have been funded by someone else. My copy is going Free as I won't be watching it again.Sincerely, do yourself a favour and source out a BBC edition. I give it (5 Stars)It is an awesome package. Inspiring and well told. Something to watch again and again(Hence I've worn out the video cassette	0
" As has been noted, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently as ""You've Got Mail"", with Tom Hanks and Meg""Trout Pout"" Ryan. Of the several versions, ""In the Good Old Summertime"" is my least favorite. The problem I think is that the studio coasted on the Stars charisma, which doesn't quite cut it here.  The chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of day old donuts, pleasant but stale. And when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. She looks like she has no neck! I don't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it's head into it's shell, all hunched up and everything. I couldn't figure out what Van Johnson was getting so hot about. I would have made a bee line for that cute violin player. And Van wasn't great either. I've always thought of him as a rather generic Hollywood leading man and he doesn't do anything to dispel that image here.    If you're a fan of the stars or the early 1900's then you might like this movie. But there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there, and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection"	0

"I was disappointed in this video.  I came to it not as a devout Catholic but as a fan of travel videos.  In other words, I watched this video with the same motivation I would have to watch Shackleton's Antarctic exploration, or something from the Globe Trekker series.With that in mind, the target audience for this video is not me.  It is the religious Catholic.  Therefore, from my perspective, I can't recommend it.  I'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion.  I don't enjoy worshipping the ""Holy Father"", or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the Swiss Guard.If you are a devout Catholic you will probably enjoy this video.  If you are not, and just came to the video because you wanted a Globe Trekker style tour of the Vatican, you are likely to be disappointed.And that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not"	0
It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie	0
Having just read the book (most highly recommended) I decided to treat myself to the movie. I could have cried. While I did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book, I was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around.In the book, the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character. In the movie, they got rid of one man, had the other eaten right off the bat, Pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy. In the book, Nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters, and he does not have an elaborate home on the island.And what about those stupid giant animals? I don't recall reading about them. The fence around Nemo's home looks like it came right from Jurassic Park.The whole story was about 5 (eventually 6) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there. On another note, the graphics were pretty bad. The panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy.As one reviewer well said, it is suitable for children who are easily pleased, but it is nothing like the book.Perhaps this is why Amazon sells it for only $6.99	0
Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout (along with partner Emilio Estevez) of pretty Madeleine Stowe (they have to watch her house through the night), and he falls in love with her. Before the movie is over there's a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer (Aidan Quinn). It's pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie, but the script is above average - especially the dialogue - and Dreyfuss's performance is right on target. A very entertaining movie; definitely worth a watch	1
"So what kind of movie is this from the director of ""I know what you did last summer?"" It's basically another installment of the same genre with a similar set-up and similar function. Deep down, Venom is just another teen slasher movie. They rode into this film with the same clichd scares, a young group of teens, a psycho killer, and a traditional ending. So is it worth seeing? That I can't completely answer for you. If you like more of the same old, then it's probably going to be a blast. The filmmakers were smart enough to throw in a few thrilling moments among the mundane, overused plot. I found some parts to be slightly unpredictable, and they did a good job detailing some suspenseful moments near the third act of the film. The voodoo element allowed for some additional surprises and kept the killer from being simply ""an unstoppable evil force.""But individually, do the separate factors of this film combine to make a masterpiece? Quite frankly, in my opinion at least....no.  Let's take a look at some of them;Acting- Well done, well directed too I might add. The acting is realistic to a degree, and brings us into the film. The actors responded (for the most part) realistically to the story line and I think that this was set-up nicely. The major issue here was the persistence in finding a gun when the killer is already dead, not to mention a demon child of voodoo hoodoo. Lighting- Dim, dark and mysterious; the lighting definitely amplified the mood of this film. Combined with the swamp-like location, I think that it sets a perfect example of what a good location combined with good lighting can do- make a relatively unattractive plot look beautiful. Special Effects- They set this up pretty well. A few scenes made me cringe and I felt that the artists working on the film definitely put their hearts into it...or bled them out for it. The gore wasn't excessive, but just right for a slasher film, and props to the director for making that call. My only qualm with this is that they used the standard Halloween ""stage blood"" which is just basically a thick bright red liquid that looks nothing like blood despite its color. A few of the actors squirm around in it, only to look like they're rolling around in pizza sauce. There are a few other tacky special effects, including the last major one in the film. The Killer- Mr. Jangles....? Enough said...sounds like a dog. I'll give the killer credit for being a good actor, but the portrayal needed a lot of work. The make-up kicked it up a notch, but the slow-motion style jumps and action-movie style stunts didn't do it justice. The man looked like an athlete and moved like one...not like a reincarnated being housing the souls of 13 evil spirits. Although I don't specifically know what that looks like....I'm sure they don't run like football players.So what overall? It's ok. Not something I'd be dying to see, and I'm glad that I didn't run to the theatre to catch the first showing. It has some good moments and some bad, but doesn't really stand out from any normal Hollywood production. My recommendation? It's ok. I'd rather go rent Containment instead; the first movie in a long time to completely blow my mind. It's good to know that there is still some talent out there somewhere and that it still filters into the film world now and again..."	0
"Joan Crawford had it. Star quality. When I first saw her in 'Grand Hotel' I was surprised how much I was watching her character instead of the equally riveting character played by the great Greta Garbo. Both were STARS. But Crawford was able to project a different kind of sensuality than Garbo - a vulnerability, a plucky girl-next-door quality.In Humoresque, an older Crawford was still able to achieve this level of performance paired off with the younger male star. Let's face it - women have a great advantage acting (perhaps women are always acting) - besides being better looking than men, they can emote more without going out of gender role. A distinct advantage vis-a-vis men who must restrict their emotional range or be accused of over acting.It's a horrible thing to fall in love. And that is just what Crawford's character does. Falls in love with the worst of all possible choices: a musician. Musicians only love music. The music in the film is worth the price of admission alone. Who amongst you would throw the first stone at a fine violinist playing 'Zigeunerwisser' or any of the other fine war horses of the classical violin repertoire?She falls in love with the young 'artist of the month' whom she offers to help jumpstart his career, renting a concert hall for his first recital. She is married to a wealthy but understanding man who loves her but lets her do what she wants - drinking, philandering ... Most men do what she wants and accept her ridicule. The character of the musician does not; he's a tough New Yorker who gives her as good as he gets - and she finds herself loving him despite herself.Love is madness, and when he starts being successful with his concert tours but neglects to phone her for weeks, she falls apart emotionally. It is profoundly humiliating to realize someone else can hurt you badly simply by declining to keep in touch. Silence is the perfect expression of contempt, isn't it? She drinks, she mopes about her 'cottage' in the Hamptons, she is crazy in love with a man who doesn't seem to reciprocate her feelings. In our time, she might see her doc and get a prescription for Zoloft to be rid of the lovesick blues and of obsessive thoughts of him. But this is before Thorazine, even, and she's just out of luck there. So she drinks. Drinking was the preferred way to deaden the unbearable pain of rejection in love in the days before designer drugs were available from your neighborhood spice man. To complicate things, her musician had an old girlfriend from the conservatory where he studied music as a young man. Additionally, there was the dreaded 'american mom' in full armor. She just had to tell this grown son of hers, repeatedly, that the woman he finally fell in love with was no good. She even slaps him upside the head as he shows her around his ritzy new apartment with a view; it seems he has too many portraits of Crawford's character in view. That's the way, Mom. Make your boy marry a good girl, like you, maybe.Meanwhile, and I just love a line the character played by Oscar Levant comes up with at her cottage in the Hamptons, ""You're not the kind of woman who lets her husband get in the way of her marriage."" A lot funnier said than written. Levant did a lot of great piano playing in the film, dropping dozens of one liners like that. He almost stole several acts. This is a very forties film. In black and white. Whatever happened to the colorization process? Oh, well.Finally, Mom tells the rich girl to keep her hands off her son. And dutifully, Crawford's character retreats to her cottage in the Hamptons, gets drunk one last time, wades into the surf in a stunning, shimmering black cocktail dress and is never seen again. I told you love was dangerous! Her lover, after cancelling one measly concert out of despair at her death, decides not to ruin a promising career and returns to the concert stage. Men! Emotional IQs of 30, at most. Well, that's all folks. If your eyes were still dry at the end of this film, you're safe - you'll never fall in love"	1
"This production is misleadingly named.  Far from being a biography of Grand Duchess Anastasia, it is really the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of Russian revolutionaries in 1918 spawned one of the 20th century's enduring mysteries -- a mystery which was given a unique lease on life when, among the myriad male and female claimants to be survivors of the imperial family, one woman began to pick up supporters in the 1920's among at least some people who had had contact with the original family.I do not fault this production for failing to be a real biography.  After all, how much of a biography can one write on a 17-year-old girl whose life was largely one of sheltered privilege?  However, I do fault this production for being a badly-flawed recounting of history.  And I am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in the arcane world of Romanov history buffs about whether Anna Anderson was really Anastasia.This work's take on the life of Anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the Romanovs, their support among their subjects, and their reputation among today's Russians.First, life in the inner sanctum of Nicholas's family was not the halcyon existence this production claims.  Certainly the family had great wealth and huge staff at its disposal.  But neither Nicholas nor Alexandra were well-suited to their roles, and they lived under the strain of it.  They were increasingly isolated from the extended Romanov clan, who shared the dawning awareness of the Russian people that the monarchy was in serious trouble.  While these forces might not have touched Anastasia directly, she was certainly touched by her brother's hemophilia and her mother's response of sinking into frail health, chronic emotional distress, and a religious mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times.Secondly, this film's portrayal of the counter-revolutionary White Army as determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just plain wrong.  While the Whites wanted to unseat the Bolshevik revolution, there was virtually no support for a Romanov restoration among the leadership of the White Army.  Nor are there any known attempts by the counter-revolutionary forces to rescue their former imperial family.  In fact, one senior White military leader once remarked, ""having seen the monarchy at close quarters, I have no desire to see its return.""And thirdly, while there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last Romanov's reputation underway in Russia today, the notion that the murdered Romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that this production claims.  In fact, the great masses of modern Russians are far more interested in making their new democracy work than in figuring out how to get the sainted Romanovs back on a throne.I do not know whether these flaws arise from some agenda to rehabilitate the Romanovs, whether they arise from sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning pseudo-history that plagues serious study of the Russian monarchy's fading years, or whether this production did not have access to newly-opened archives.  But -- whatever the reason(s) -- it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be history when it is, in fact, closer to a grocery-store romance novel"	0
"Apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film, but when I re-watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so, I found it to be . . . well, nearly unwatchable.What's so bad about it?  Well, how shall I begin . . .(1)  Sean Connery is a dud.  There can be very little doubt that Connery is THE James Bond, but here, he seems like he's just going through the motions.  To be fair, he had no decent material to play.  The only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging 007; he seems suitably worn-out at various points, and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before.  But these are grace notes; by and large, Connery is stiff as a board here.(2)  The action scenes are uninspiring.  I'm not the biggest fan of the Roger Moore Bond films, but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes.  Here, the action is strictly second-rate.(3)  Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera, though great to look at, give terrible performances.(4)  There is literally no reason to see this in favor of ""Thunderball,"" of which it is a remake; the original remains one of the all-time great screen entertainments, and this remake makes ZERO improvements.  In fact, the plot merely becomes muddled.(5)  There are a series of awful performances in supporting roles.  Rowan Atkinson's comic scenes, though brief, are painfully unfunny, not to mention out of place.  The actor playing the ""new"" M is odious; and whoever it is playing Q isn't very good, either.(6)  The music is bad.  The title song is boring, and the score by Michel Legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I couldn't care less that the James Bond theme is missing; it's not what isn't there that's bad, it's what IS there.All in all, I'd have to say that -- unless we're counting the 1967 version of ""Casino Royale"" -- this is THE worst of the James Bond movies.  It's worth seeing if you've never seen it before . . . but that's about it, in my opinion"	0
"I'm not going to comment on the episodes because almost all of them can be found on the Season 1 & 2 box sets, which is how you're better off seeing them (at least they're in order and paired together with the proper companion episodes).  Instead I will be focusing on the bonus features.  Not the Violent Femmes music video, because that too can be found on the Season 1 box set, but on the cast and crew interviews that make up the rest of the bonus features.  I love the interviews and the ""in studio"" voice recording re-enactments, but I *HATE* how EVERY piece of this great footage is ruined because someone thought it would be a great idea to cover up almost the entire screen with a bubble graphic frame.  You can only see the video through a small round part of the middle of your tv screen, and even then it isn't clear as there's a bubble ""shine"" over it.  I'd love for Paramount/Nick to include all of the original, non-bubblefied footage on the season 3 box set, even though most of the episodes are for seasons 1 and 2"	0
"This is one of my all-time favorite vampire movies. The cast led by Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat, and Brad Pitt as the vampire Louis does an excellent job of bringing to life Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire. The costumes and sets are evocative of the respective eras the vampires live through, and the cinematography is lush and sensual, evoking the decadent lifestyle that Lestat leads...even Kirsten Dunst has a role here as a child vampire, and her famous line ""I want some more"" has been rendered immortal in movie history. The chemistry between Lestat [Cruise] & Louis [Pitt] is believable and in fact, they give one of their best dramatic performances in this movie. All in all, a cinematic treat"	1

"I really forgot how good some of those first season early episodes were until I bought the season 1 DVD. ""Skin Deep"" is probably the most entertaining episode of the series. Other standouts are ""China Doll"" and ""J ""Digger"" Doyle"". What I enjoyed most was the 1982 crossover episode as the featuring Gerald McRaney and Jamison Parker from Simon and Simon from season 2. Also the Simon episode ""Emeralds are a girls best friend"" and although not as big a fan of later seasons, the 2 part season 5 opener w/ a young unknown Sharon Stone playing a psycho...big surprise there. I found it neat with the discoesque theme song for the first 10 episodes too. You could see how the 4 main characters found their niche as the season progressed"	1

Who'd have thought that John Wayne and the director of ""Support Your Local Sherrif"" would have joined forces for this stinker!The characterization hints at being good, but really its character actors doing what they do best - being good support characters. Its a good thing to because the Duke really just mailed this one  in.First - what this movie does well:-Ann Margaret is good and she looks great dressed up like a cowboy.-the supporting cowboy characters literally steal the show.-it is interesting that the bad guys chasing Ann Margaret and John Wayne and his cast of cronies are never ever seen close up until the very end. When you get to the end, you learn why, but it works well to keep them faceless.-the last 10 minutes is good - top notch with a twister of an ending.HOWEVER, what is wrong with the movie is stronger than what is right:-John Wayne is absolutely uninspired - he is just a cardboard version of himself - a cranky, mean man who they rarely even try to develop as a character - and when they do, it seems very, very clunky.-At least 20 minutes of this movie consists of long-distance shots of people riding horses. Sometimes, they ride over hills, sometimes they ride through valleys. We get 4 separate long shots of them crossing a wide pond that is supposed to be the Rio Grande (the border with Mexico). Fill in this time with some character development! Some dialogue! Anything!-the character actors keep referring to other events in the past that sound a lot more interesting than this movie.All in all, it seems like this was the rough draft of a great script that was rushed to film just so John Wayne could have another movie in the theaters. Too bad, a crack team of writers could have made it something special.My suggestion, get ""Cowboys"" or either of the two ""Rooster Cogburn"" movies or ""Support Your Local Sherrif"" and see this actor and this director doing much better work!"	0
I love the Simpsons!  Although the early seasons are classic, they seem to get better and more funny as they go on.  This season includes the episode where Milhouse's parents get divorced which is hilarious, and the one where Homer eats those hot chili peppers and freaks out!  Definitely worth the purchase, there are a lot of extras too	1
This is a good 1st season set for the series of Criminal Intent.  I strongly recommend this if you are a fan	1
I LOVE A LOT OF B MOVIE HORROR,BUT THIS NOT THAT GREAT.I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER HAVING GUNNER HANSON IN IT,AND GORDON LEWIS,THE STORY LINE WAS OK.THE GORE WASNT THERE,LITTLE SCEENS OF IT.AGAIN I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE(SHOCKORAMA)ANYWAYS IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT GETTING IT,I WOULD FIRST RENT IT.SEE IF YOU LIKE IT,I WOULDNT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FULL PRICE DVD.THE MUSIC SCORE WAS COOL FOR SURE	0
I suppose it's alright if you like overlong musicals focusing on maniacal, manipulative mothers	0
I didn't enjoy the film.  I also didn't enjoy the original play by Shakespeare.  King Lear is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays.  I don't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add nothing of value to the original.  You can set it wherever you like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up three hours of your time.A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son.  The youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father.  He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated shabbily.  He's wanted dead or dead.In this treatment of the annoying plot, he loses his mind.  He has a faithful follower or two.  They overact.  There is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play.  Lear Hidetoro is an absolute jerk.  Am I supposed to care what happens to him?  Why?  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one?  You may as well cry over Saddam Hussein.Look at this movie with fresh eyes.  Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes.  This stuff simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good.  The hell with King Lear.  He's an annoyance	0
First of all, who was the spastic genius who decided that concert films had to change camera angles every five seconds? This is terribly anoying, especially when every third shot is of the same audience members. This may be fun for a home video, but not for a mass marketed commercial release.The Dance Hall Crashers are an awesome band. Much of the fun of seeing the DHC in concert is their highly kinetic stage presence. It would have been great if this DVD had concentrated on the band as a whole and not just different extreme closeups switched at a dizzying rate. And since the DHC are supposed to be the focus, why does the director insist on featuring so many shots of the audience? It gets on your nerves. I love the DHC. Their live CD has a permanent place on my playlist. But this horribly made DVD only made it through three songs. Perhaps if I had been at the front of the stage that night, I would appreciate it more.	0

I rarely write reviews, but quoting Ebert(who inexplicably liked this!): I HATED THIS MOVIE.  1. Is editor the correct term to apply to Joe Klotz?  I give him credit for making a move under 2 hours feeling like 4.  If you want to see a good slow paced movie watch L'Aaventura.  For a much better recent indie film about family life buy the Squid and the Wale.  2. If the director hoped to elicit the sterotypical slow pace of southern life he succeeded too well. Amy Adams earned acclaim for playing yet another dumb, but sweet southerner (see Forrest Gump, Waterboy).  I guess her performance reaffirmed what Hollywood thinks of the south.  Notice all the glowing reviews come from people either from California or NY.  Does the intelligent southerner exist in the minds of studio execs?  3. I assume that people like this movie because of some form of self deception or masochism.  I feel bad for the masochists, but not the pretentious pseudo-intellectuals who can conjure meaning from a film devoid of a plot or artistic merit.  4. RENT THIS FIRST and be thankful you will only lose 2 hours of your life not $19.9	0
Why the production team of this movie didn't film in New Orleans is beyond my comprehension. When I first saw this movie, I could see based on the footage that it was filmed in Canada. The terrain is totally different from south Louisiana. It looked like a movie set. I guess the set designers thought they could put a few stands of fake Spanish moss on the trees and a hunk of it in the fountains and a banana tree in that corner and a palm in the other. It looked like a theme park! The streets looked too clean. For some reason they could not depict the elegance of decay of old New Orleans which to me is paramount in the telling of these people's lives but maybe I am being too technical. All the principle characters  all had straight teeth and clear skin. Back in the 1840's just about everybody had some sort of illness then and they looked it. The actor who played Marcel could not act. The actor who played his white father did not age at all for 18 years. Still looked the same, yet he had very young children by his white wife who he married 18 years before. The architecture of the plantation house was also wrong. It was'nt even FrenchNo live oaks anywhere which are major icons in southern Louisiana.The supporting actors and actresses were quite good.Let me just say this, white men maintaining women of color was not only prevelent in New Orleans but also other states in the south, the difference is is that in New Orleans, the white master would leave them property and money. Not so in other southern states.The more beautiful the woman, the more she would receive from the white man.The placage system in New Orleans was a business arrangement and it worked for both parties.	0
This Scooby-Doo VHS is ABSOULTY HORRIBLE!! It lacks exciting adventures and silly antics of the Scooby-Doo team too drawn out and serous not anough scary monsters or surprises...too much boring details not anough silly actions that kids like....Plus its higher cost I paid 9.95 TRUST ME BUY Scooby-Doo 2 or Scooby-Doo Cyber Chase Those keep the kids glued to the T.V. very exciting Just the way we want Scooby Doo to be!!	0
i have been waiting to see this film for a while now. and i just finally saw it i'm very dissapointed. this was nothing but a low budget horror flick with cheap trills. the film sucks!!! the nazi zombies coming back from there watery graves to terrorize modern day tourist that are in a small boat. and get stranded on a deserted isolated island. was a great! idea except that with this film you're going to be very bored and dissapointed if you ask me. i was expecting a lot more than this the zombie nazi's make up looks silly. they're not even frightning or scary they just made me laugh. the picture quality has aged even if it's dvd format very grainy poor picture quality. i have seen other movies from the 1970's on dvd and the picture quality looks excellent almost like new or like it has been digitally remasterd for it's age. but this was awful. the only good thing it has was decent acting lol. like i said before this is nothing but a (low budget cheap horror film) rent it if you like. but dont purchased it it will be a waste of your money and time.  	0
I must be missing something, i bought this movie... when i watched it i fell asleep, its boring as hell trust me im a true horror fan and a gore-fiend, this movie was NOTHING, the only gore was when this guy cut some lady in the heart and it looked so fake.... the ONLY scary part was the end with this witch, is everyone high but me? this movie sucked! boring as hell.. 2 stars	0
"Overproduction and heavy use of repetitive ""special"" effects (such as Rothbart's enlarged and projected image ""flying"" over the heads of Siegfried and Odette) make this version of Swan Lake funny.  Anorexia ""survivor"" Evelyn Hart's role as Odette/Odile makes watching the video painful.  She is horribly gaunt and looks too fragile to be dancing:  I was plagued with worries that she would collapse at any second. Not worth the money, in my opinion"	0
This is a great DVD collection of a great show. I hope that they follow up this set and the Christmas set with another 3 disc set of shows. As great as this set is, it just left me wanting more. I hope they deliver. There are still many, many classic episodes left to be seen. It was worth every penny.	1

"While this certainly isn't the best pearl jam concert ever it isn't the worst either. The first disc starts a little slow..but you can't argue with getting to hear song's like ""In My Tree"" and ""Faithfull"".Highlights are:Love Boat Captain...a nice opener. One of the best of riot act song's for sure.In My Tree, one of, if not my favorite pj songs. Not quite as rocking as the 2000 tour performances but still great.Gimme Some Truth.  Maybe not a technically perfect perfomance but heartfelt and passionate. Good john lennon cover.Even Flow. Always great.Spin the black circle...the band starts to get more into the show after this rocking performance.Thumbing My Way...just a great slow song.Breath. In my opinion the best performance of the show...just great.Crown of Thorns. I really like this version of the song...played well whether you think ed should sing it or not.Baba O'Reilly.  The classic ""who"" song. A great performance. Just try to sit still during this one.I would reccomend this dvd to anyone that is a pearl jam fan already but if you're not then I would start with some of their studio albums first."	1
One of the best films of all time!  Fans of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant are in for a treat with this one	1
This Amicus horror anthology film has got to be the weakest in the series, the storylines were terrible and very dull and most of the time it looked like it was very outdated not to mention that the last episode about a washed up actor who turns into a vampire was not funny. Usually these Amicus films are fun to watch and not scary but good however this film just dragged along, the episode with Christopher Lee in it was the best one and the only one that was worth watching and Ingrid Pitt as a sexy vampire thats it, what a waste	0
I really enjoyed this movie and felt it was better than the remake.  Both this one and the new one hold to a very similar story line	1
"George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying ""Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.' But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one. "	0
watched like reading a comic book. so many murders for so little money. corpses never turned stink in the thailand humid and hot temperature. lousy acting, directing and totally stupid screenplay with twisted to the limit ridiculousness and impossibility. a story so bad that turned into a disturbing watch. boasted with awards and high praises for the primitiveness or roughness of the poor plot and scenario? give me a break	0

"I saw this crapfest in the theater and I should have known what I was getting into when we were carded not only at the ticket window, but at the entrance of the theater as well.  I only gave it one star because there wasn't a ""no star"" rating--even though it deserves a negative rating.  As a horror fan, I was intrigued at seeing the movie and as the movie started, it seemed to have alot of promise.  But once we met Baby and her ""family"" the movie went downhill at an accelerated rate.  The movie was disgusting, repulsive, and made no clear sense--at least with Michael or Freddie you knew what the h*ll was going on.  And I thought that Blood Sucking Freaks and Blood Sucking Vampires from Pittsburgh sucked, but Corpses not only sucked, it blew. As a friend told me later, ""What in the h*ll did you expect from Rob Zombie?""  What did I expect indeed.  No wonder most production firms refused to touch this film"	0
I love this seasion but the packaging could be better, I got cut with my copy of it	1
This film is a must-see for any dancer.  The clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative.  Many famous scenes from the old MGM  musicals to the water spray scene in Flashdance are used to illustrate how  diversified dancing in films can be.  For ballet dancers, there is a  portion devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by Mikhail  Baryshnikov.  Scenes of Rudolph Nureyev leaping through the air compliment  this section as well as scenes from various ballets.  Liza Minelli hosts  the Broadway inspirational portion which is shorter in length.  I only saw  this film once but I feel that it is a must-own selection for any dancer	1
I saw this movie and was shocked at the contents, considering that it was aimed at children. It starts out with the gypsy Esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance. While no stripping happened, there wasn't much other difference in the style of dance. Later in the movie, one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner I would never want my children to see. He sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he doesn't have her, and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire. Regardless of the rest of the movie, these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children. Not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel, which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one.	0
     My major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires. These extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u-v lamp, vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin, and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun. Vampires are supposed to be scary, but how frightened of them should I be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him. Writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable. The first Underworld movie would be a good model.                          	0
Weird, whacked out interpretation of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland that combines live-action with some stop-action animation to create a creeped out dreamscape.  White rabbit is a sawdust-stuffed real rabbit that escaped from the taxidermy stand, caterpillar is an old stocking with dentures and glass eyes, Mad Hatter is a marionette and March Hare is a wind-up stuffed toy rabbit with a loose button eye.  Devoted Alice fans may have a different reaction, but I found Jan Svankmajer's Alice disturbing and, at times, tedious. Everyday objects - the stuff in Alice's room - become the stuff of the dream.  Playing cards become Red Queen and entourage, the White Rabbit has a nasty looking set of incisors and a distressing tendency to shed his sawdust guts, Alice herself becomes her own blank-faced doll.  There's no law that says Alice has to be bright and cuddly, but it sure helps.  Whether intentional or not, Svankmajer's Alice is grim and nightmarish.  Svankmajer animates figures in motion- real figures, like dolls and stuffed and mounted rabbits and such - but he doesn't animate facial expressions.  Combine that with the flat tone of voice by the film's narrator - ALICE is narrated by the actress who plays Alice, dubbed into English, or course - and the film has a flat, dead feeling.  The film, oddly enough for an animated feature, is leadenly paced. Some scenes seem to run on forever.  The tea party with the Mad Hatter (a marionette) and the March Hare (a bedraggled plush toy bunny with an annoyingly ill-attached button eye) runs on and on, the animation repeating itself way past our limit of patience.  The Mad Hatter wants a new cup of tea (`Change chairs!'), the March Hare scoots around in a wheelchair.  The new seats are taken, the tea is poured, the Mad Hatter wants a news cup of tea (`Change chair!') and on, and on, and on.  Sheesh - thought that scene would never end.  Look - I'm not that big a fan of Carroll's Alice stories in the first place, but the movie adaptations of his stories - be they Disney's animated movie or the 1933 full-length feature with Ned Sparks as the Catepillar and Sterling Holloway as the frog - all have had something going for them.  Comedy, for one thing. Svankmajer's inspiration is laudable, but his execution is often disappointing.  His Alice is dark, grim, humorless and not everyone's cup of chai.    It's like listening to a quiet sonata played by an acid jazz band - it's familiar enough, probably good enough for the converted, but hard for the uninitiated to embrace and unlikely to win any new fans.    	0
China: The Panda Adventure is an IMAX film that tells a story..So..in a sense the Pandas are a part of this story but not in the sense of a documentary.  The story is set in 1936 and is based on a true story involving Ruth Harkness who has arrived in China to take care of the business affairs of her late husband.  Her husband, it seems was a great admirer of the Giant Panda and in his journal he writes a beautiful story about his experiences with them..This leads Ruth to seek these Pandas out to see for herself..As the story unfolds we see the beauty and majesty of China..The cinematography is outstanding and the music fits the film quite well..Ruth is played by the lovely Maria Bello and there is an additional documentary about the making of this film is which she talks about her reasons for wanting to do this film and her fascination with the Panda..All in all..this film is a nice way to spend the evening with your family..but be warned..it's more of a story involving the Panda and not a documentary.	1
This woman may have a great body, but she cannot teach dancing for anything. In the 35 minute 'cardio dance' portion, dance steps are taught frustratingly fast (and this is from somebody that enjoys dancing!).  It took so long to figure out the steps--which are not your 'typical' exercise or step class steps--that I shut the DVD off and jumped on the treadmill.  The two 15 minute hip and thigh workouts are a little better, but you really need to do them both back-to-back to feel any benefits. I would say this is a good video for anybody thats got LOTS of patience to learn the moves and an alternate workout for the first few times you run the DVD, because you'll get no benefit from the workout while trying to figure out what she's doing.  Save your money! 	0
"Sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie, but Peter Sellers did many better films than this. ""Dr. Strangelove"" was the masterpiece.  ""Being There"" is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in Washington.  ""The World of Henry Orient"" (AT LAST on DVD!)is priceless but virtually unknown, with delicious performances from Sellers and especially his teenage tormentors.  Finally, the ""Pink Panther"" series is much better slapstick than ""After the Fox,"" which has many famous, talented participants but is mostly silly, unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as Clouseau & Co. One irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations, as if we might not notice them otherwise. I agree with other reviewers that Victor Mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted, and Martin Balsam does okay with his stuff, too. When watching this film, I kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant -- I could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money"	0
Great movie for all ages. Our family realy enjoyed this movie. Highly recomend	1
Like Stuart Gordon's other venture into science fiction territory, the underrated and ill-fated ROBOT JOX, this is a nifty little film that was plagued by production difficulties and failed to find a theatrical distributor, which is a shame because its quite an enjoyable viewing experience. Everyone joins in the fun in this one, with Dennis Hopper delivering some unexpectedly funny bits of dialog, Debi Mazar and Stephen Dorff providing reliable 2nd banana support and Charles Dance having the time of his life with his horny half-metal madman. This Excellent DVD offers a chance to see this little sleeper in a great looking print with a fascinating and funny commentary by the Director.	1
This movie is high in my top 10 off all times list, and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood' movie I can think of. I watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying, thrilling and suspenseful as it was when I saw it first more than 10 years ago. My 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well. Great performance by all cast but especially Hanks, Paxton and Beacon. Probably Ron Howard best film ever	1
A film that's a little like trying to find your way out of a house of mirrors or an attempt to reassemble an  image once it has been split by a prism. Since nothing is as it seems, we may as well be inside a fictionalized world; like the Unicorn story the main character, Cathryn, is writing. This fantasy is read aloud throughout the film creating a framework whose only relevance to the story unfolding, is to reassure us that we have stepped into a world that is a creation of the imagination; however, the fact that is comes from the mind of a schizophrenic is hardly reassuring. A glance at the cast of characters hints that they are not necessarily who or what they seem (Hugh is played by Rene, Rene is played by Marcel who is played by Hugh. Cathryn is played by Susannah and Susannah plays Cathryn). Insanity is not an ordering principle of the mind, but rather a vain attempt to put order to an ever-changing palette of images that may or may not be reflections of images within the mind instead of outside. A very atmospheric film made more so by the disturbing score that is not altogether in sync with the action, another technique that constantly keeps the viewer off balance	1
"Supposed being victimized by local communist regime and Soviet oppressors since August-1968, a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like  surgical gloves he did at hospitals.No wonder, sex is a fix for such a lucky, and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with Southern European rather than Slavic appearance a little.Extended up to 165 minutes of screening, romantic tale with some near-porno inclusions is a bit more over-positive and over-entertaining than its final collapsed in.Well, movie spirit seems being similar to ""A Beautiful Life"", ""Producers"" or, more recent one of Levi's Hitler-as-a-comedy-hero, of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only.

This is one of the worst edited documentary I have ever seen.You can not have a single shot spoiled with flashes, slow motion, and unnecessary digital FX. I have nothing against crazy editing when it is for a 3 min MTV music clip or a TV add. But on a 7 hours documentary you get airsick.If fine edited, all this interresting story could have been told in less than two hours.Each episode has a more than 2 min introduction... During the episodes you see some shots more than ten times.By the way, I am a very long time aviation enthousiast	0
"""Ils se marirent et eurent beaucoup d'enfants"" (""Happily Ever After"") is a cleverly written examination of contemporary views on love, lust, marriage, infidelity, and the single life.  Writer/Director/Actor Yvan Attal has come up with a winner, an entertaining, funny, and ultimately thoughtful treatise on how we cope with partnering.Three men work together in a car dealership.  Vincent (Yvan Attal) is the apparently happily married man with a beautiful wife Gabrielle (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and child.  Georges (Alain Chabat) on the other hand is in a tumultuous marriage with Nathalie (Emmanuelle Seigner) who has gender issues that go far beyond feminism and negatively influence their child.  Fred (Alain Cohen) is single, bedding every lovely woman he encounters, balancing trysts between mornings, afternoons, and evenings and is deeply envied for his Don Juanism. But Fred actually longs for the sense of belonging that married men enjoy.The men's lives intertwine on many levels.  Most important, we discover that Vincent has a lover (Angie David) despite his idyllic married life and while it is Georges whom one would expect to seek solace from a lover, he remains faithful to his nagging wife!  Gabrielle senses Vincent's affair and encounters a sexy man in a music shop (Johnny Depp) who begins to preoccupy her thoughts.  She is a real estate broker and comes close to an assignation with a client but remains faithful. All the while she daydreams about her brief encounter with Depp and satisfies her wandering eye with those memories.  Fred discovers that one of his paramours is pregnant and happily decides to leap into the married fray.  The only 'adults' sharing advice here are Vincent's long married parents (Anouk Aime and Claude Berri in very welcome comeback cameos!) and it is this 'standard' that adds the final humor to the film.The manner in which all three men deal with their living situations asks as many questions as it gives answers.  Attal finds joy in all forms of coupling and is careful to offer all sides of decisions his characters make in arriving at what provides them happiness.  This is a smart movie with terrific twists.  There is just enough slapstick (an all out food fight between Vincent and Gabrielle - real life husband and wife team Attal and Gainsbourg - that proves to be one of the fun-loving bits of silliness that binds their marriage) to keep the mood light.  Not a profound film, but a joyous French comedy handled by total pros!  In French and English with subtitles. Recommended. Grady Harp, October 0"	1
I like this movie.A meeting happened in our life is very special and nearly miracle, but we don't think so almost always. The story except political things in this movie is thinkable around here.Screenplay and performance of both Bill Nighy and Kelly McDonald have led this movie to the excellent one.PS: I don't understand why this movie is not released in Japan	1

Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie	0
I wish I could give this movie zero stars. It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie.The sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did. At least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be	0
I was all geeked to watch this but was disapponted...I don't feel lke they picked the right person to direct this movie.  It seemed very empty to me! The fighting scenes were blah and that was what really blew it for me...maybe if it was longer it would have been better?  I don't know...and then there was a mini plot with a brother and sister that SEEMED OUT OF PLACE!!  sigh...Azumi was a much better martial arts sword movie	0
An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot;.  Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman	0
I've been a longtime fan of Seagal's movies, but I was greatly disappointed by this film.  First, there were clearly sections where Steven Seagal's voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him. (Clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming) It was surprising that they could not take the time to get Seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections.  There were also very few action sequences that demonstrated Seagal's skills with martial arts.  In many ways, this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film. Little action, but lots of bloody corpses lying about.  I enjoyed Black Dawn far more, and feel it was a much better made film	0

Maggie Gyllenhaal played her part to perfection, scarily so.  She's the perfect sociopath, only thinking of herself while using her daughter, as well as anyone else she encounters, as a foil.  She's a master manipulator and feels no remorse for using anyone unlucky enough to cross her path.All in all a real slice of life film accurately depicted, directed and played	1
I didn't even want to see this movie, but my brother read the book and wanted to see it.  (We were unaware of the fact that this wasn't meant to follow the book...)Everything was poorly done in this movie.  Even Hans Zimmer's score didn't save it.  I've mentioned that I'd like it if one could rate an item with negative stars, and if I could, I'd give it negative ten	0
the movie title itself says a lot, the movie itself is a total scam, fools people to rent or to watch it. a horrible directing, script and performance. you'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie	0
"""A provocative and surprising thriller."" (Fangoria) Yeah it is surprising, surprising-ly bad. It's also provocative, it provoked me to write this bad review.  From the beginning I could tell the director, Chris Fisher, was attempting to create a stylistic film.  However, after the third pointless scene of swirling overlapping shots and panning camera work I gave up.  If you're using style, have a reason.  Style without reason is not style.  This film is one thing, if nothing else, a great lesson in how to over use overlapping shots (also known as crossdisolving shots).  Drink too much and spin around for 10 seconds and you'll get the same effect as the camera work/editing of the film.  There's so much overlapping shots in this film, there's probably 2 1/2 hours of footage on the screen in the 85 minutes that the film is.  It's full of tallent, bad tallent.  It's more about naked women, sex, and drugs than the actual story.  I expected a cheap nock-off of The Life of David Gale. I would have enjoyed that 100 times more that this.  This is bad, annoyingly bad.  Some moron wanted to make a film and got all hung up editing.  Annette Davey, the editor, should have her name removed from the film.  Unless, for some unknown reason, she's proud of her work. If I was studio head at Silver Nitrate Entertainment and somone presented me the final cut of this film, I'd have everyone and anyone associated with it fired, immediately without question.  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment made a mistake with the distribution of this film.  If you enjoy good movies and great camera work, STAY AWAY from this film"	0
I first saw this movie on TV as a college student. I loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on VHS tape. I have watched this movie so many times I'm surprised the VHS tape is still working!The actors are perfectly cast in the leads. They are so believeable in their portrayals that I could have gone to high school with them. The kissing scene is HOT. Clothes don't need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene.The characters are not glossy, and that is what I love about John Hughes. He portrays coming-of-age in all its naked and truest glory, not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years.If you're looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack, this is your type of movie	1
Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..	0

Operations officer   During World War II the British Royal Air Force maintained nighttime bombing raids over Europe, while the United States Army Air Corps made large daylight raids. Since the Air Corps was clearly visible, their losses were heavy. American fighter cover did not have sufficient range to accompany the bombers, mainly the B-17 &quot;Flying Fortresses,&quot; mainly from the Eighth Air Force, all the way to their German targets and back, which made them highly vulnerable. We lost 50,000 men in the air over Europe during that war.  This is the fictional story of some of the men who fought that air war.  Brig. Gen. K.C. 'Casey' Dennis (Clark Gable) is in command of a bomber division composed of several groups attempting to destroy the aircraft plants in Germany that are producing the Messerschmidt 262 jet fighter (the first operational jet fighter in the Second World War). The German jet was much faster and better armed than our P-51 'Mustang', P-47 'Thunderbolt', or P-38 'Lightning', our three best escort fighters, and was causing massive losses in the air.  Dennis was obstructed by higher ranking generals who were worried about the reaction of the politicians and newsmen who were reporting the high losses to the American public.  The course of the war was, indeed, in reality, affected by just such considerations, as it is in every war. This is a far better film, and reflected the reality of that particular war far better than I expected. I appreciated it. It was a well-acted, well motivated drama.

"Alec Baldwin has always been the best host of SNL (along with Walken and Spacey) and this makes a pretty good case why.The opening sketch with the press conference about Prince Charles is priceless.  And what could be more demented than ""Canteen Boy.""  Baldwin is so over-the-top in that that what is a really, really sick joke is actually funny.But the home runs come with three of the funniest sketches of all time: The Tony Bennet Show (I was seizing during this one), The Joe Pesci Show (with Baldwin doing DeNiro) and the ""Zinger"" sketch, which just got funnier as it went along.  Even better was the voicemail sketch where he keep re-recording his greeting, only to listen back to it and hear a gay man.There are a couple of clunkers: ""Planet Truth"" was just not that funny and maybe two others didn't need to be here.  Including one so-so opening monologue that probably was only included because it included Paul McCartney.The bonus features include one great sketch that never made it on-air, and a great audio track by Baldwin and the Producer of SNL which provides lots of really, really entertaining stories about the cast and the sketches themselves.Absolutely hilarious"	1
It is very nice and they delever it very fast	1
"The movies of course are dated, but fascinating also.  The picture quality was excellent as was the sound.  The main iterest was in seing how much movie stories have changed.  Now even the simplest movie, regardless of the subject has an edge.  These ""horror"" movies of the 40s-50s are gentler, less scary, with a clear statement of good and evil. Now we view things differently without any absolute judgments. Clarity has given way to a more unsettled world"	1
I enjoyed this movie a lot. Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd are both very appealing in these roles, and Greg Kinnear does a nice job with his as well - the jerk who's just so charming that you can't resist, even when you know better than to fall for it. Ellen Barkin does fine with her small role but it is weird that she is the one listed first	1
If you love well written stories, great plots and captivating acting then this movie IS NOT for you.I don't know how the producer managed to swindle precious investor dollars to get this tripe made into a movie, however there it is!It was SO BORING and so badly done that after the first 1 hour and 45 minutes I had to turn it off. I don't even want to know how it ended.The cast line up was great! That's the only 'positive' comment I can make with regards to this movie.DO NOT watch it. DO NOT hire it. DO NOT believe anybody who thinks it is good.The two lesbians who made love even did that scene poorly; get this, it was done in the missionary position!Avoid this movie	0
"to start I am a very big fan of Doris Day for yeays. I had just bought the 6 DVD box set of her movies & loved that so I decided to buy this TV series. It is so awful words can't describe it. It's not because it's ""dated"" because I Love Lucy is alot older & sheer perfection. It's initially nice to see Doris in another genre but this first series just doesn't work for me for many reasons. The subject matters chosen are thoughtful(that's the reason I gave it TWO stars & the presence of Doris)..I'll tell you the show just bored me & I found myself fast forworded through  the last 10 episodes.the DVD extra interviews with two members of the cast are interesting. There's NO new interviews with Doris(that's an old interview they put on there).I think the only thing new is that 8x10 shot with her dog"	0

"This DVD was a waste of money and a waste of time.  It's ""unauthorized"" by MUSE, so therefore there were no interviews, no live footage, and none of their music was included.

I have a 2 year old and have seen him on all the Kids Channels.  I was hoping the DVD would show each of his songs as they are performed on TV.  Instead it was like a concert and did not keep my attention nor my sons.  This would have been a better CD instead of a DV	0

"I had heard a lot about how funny Margaret Cho was, and finally got a chance to watch her video. I find her way overrated.She does have some funny stuff. She's got a particular knack for doing impressions, and there's some other genuinely funny material.However, the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience. She does a lot of vulgar material, homosexual-oriented jokes, etc. that are clearly just there for the ""outlaw"" value. And she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base. It's just... not funny."	0
Simply the most entertaining mockumentary / film I've seen in years and one of the best ever. The DVD is packed full of extras and outtakes so the fun lasts much longer than you'd expect. Jenna Fischer is brilliant and James Gunn is hilarious.  You just have to buy it to understand	1
"Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of ""Mississippi Burning"" or the anger and impunity of ""Ghosts of Mississippi"", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade ""Miss Congeniality"" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not ""a powerful film."" It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like ""Mississippis Burning,"" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies"	0
I enjoy Greek Mythology and I love this story. Although there was alot of bad acting especially from the lead character Jason, who acted like he was stoned throughout the film. I was expecting the Hydra guarding the golden fleece but got a oversized Komoto Dragon(Lost me there) This Film had potential but the director went off on some wierd drug indused trip.  Overall I was dissappointed and was expecting more.  Sorry	0
"The Next Generation is basically a remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical, though different characters and locations are used.  The original was a little overrated in my opinion and this ""remake"" is quite frankly terrible.  Bad acting with the exception of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several B movie actors.  The only major differences from the original are that Leatherface now dresses as a woman, which was fairly amusing but hardly essential, and a tacked on conspiracy theory.The conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous, I won't explain it, theres no point, watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends.  I would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though, even die hards admit its awful, I only gave it 2 stars because I reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst (yes even worse than this!)"	0
The movie is about two men who fake fairytales for money. They are employed to stop these children from disapearing into a forest in a town. Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm take on the job or be forced to die and go into the forest. This is a really good movie and is an action packed fairytale	1
'Big Trouble' has a lot of big things going for it...big laughs, big plot, big cast...and because of all this it loses a peg or two...for there's just sooooo much for it to keep up with itself...you get somewhat lost in the jumble.  The film stars Tim Allen in the central role, if you could call it that, as a journalist who gets himself and his son (Foster) thrown into one weirdly twisted plot involving crazed criminals (Sizemore & Knocksville) a hitman (Farina) a wealthy jerk-off of a man (Tucci), the mans wife (Russo) her daughter (Zooey) a homeless man that resembles Jesus (Lee in a histerical role) some mobsters, dimwitt cops (Garofalo & Warburton), FBI agents with attitude (Heavy-D & Epps) and a toad that sprays hallucinogenic saliva.  See all that and I haven't even got to the plot, but it's one of those things you'd have to see to really understand.  Lets just say everyone has a different agenda and they all get in each others way until everyones agenda changes to be someone elses entirly.  Does that sum it up?  It's funny, real funny, but it's also tightly woven without much room to adjust since it moves at such a frantic pace, keeping you watching closly to understand all that's going on.  It'll mae sense in the end though, I promise	1
I got season one from a friend as a gift and loved it.  I bought season two and was pretty dissappointed.  The show just became vulgar and sacrificed the hilarity of season one.  I loved the ideas for episodes, but didn't care much for how they played out.  Bill got soft.  Cuddles and Dan got mean.  Buttons and Rocko stayed about the same, but it wasn't enough.  Great show, but stick with season one	0

Filmed at New York's Improv in 1971, we see a young Pryor working on perfecting the kind of material that made him famous. More polished versions of some of these routines may be found on the 1971 album &quot;Craps After Hours.&quot; However, witness the powerful moment when he alludes to his mother's prostitution, then drops his head in sadness and takes a drag from his cigarette after realizing what he has just said. This scene alone is worth the price of admission in this important look at what was to come	1
I love David Cross's comedy,  I love his stand up, I love Mr. Show. But this dvd is not kinda boring, it is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  There may be a few folks who find something entertaining in this dvd -- there is no accounting for taste. But 98 out of 100 normal people will simply shake their heads trying to figure out why this dvd was released	0
My girlfriend made me buy this video after a night of dancing at the local club. All I can say is that the way Marlon builds steps made it easy for someone who has no coordination like me. Looking forward to getting part II next	1
I thought the video was well done.  It was good to feature the clinchinggames of the Division and League Championship Series plus all four gamesof the World Sries.  I think they should have included at least the high- lights on a extra disk of Games 1 and 2 of the Division Series againstBoston and Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the League Championship Series againstLos Angeles.  Still, I highly recommend this collection for all gung-hoWhite Sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88years.  A great viewing companion for those cold winter nights	1
When Once and Again first began I dismissed it as a show for just women. But after watching just one episode I found myself hooked. This was unlike any show I had seen before. I actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families. Once and Again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love. It goes much deeper than that. Once and Again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well. But then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well. With the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell) and how their ex's still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children. Once and Again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today. Even thought it's time on television was short Once and Again showcased the acting talents of Sela Ward and Billy Campbell and launched the careers of Shane West and Evan Rachel Wood. I am just glad that we are able to enjoy this fine show on DVD and that they have finally decided to release Seasons 2 and 3	1
"Fifty-five minutes into this film, after Freya (Jane March) listens to the Beast's explanation of his current condition--it is the punishment of Odin for killing a bear--she says, ""What does it mean? It makes no sense."" Although there is still half an hour yet to come, these eight words pretty much sum up this low-budget variant of ""Beauty and the Beast."" The very title BLOOD OF BEASTS (plural) makes no sense. The film shows us only one beast--a kind of man-bear--and he is a revived and metamorphosed version of Odin's pet bear, blended or fused with the man who killed it. Academic scholars might argue that swaggering-but-cowardly Sven (played by William Gregory Lee) is a kind of beast as well (thus giving us TWO beasts), but we have no way of knowing what the writer and director intended. Most likely the title was devised by somebody in the marketing department who had not seen the film. Surely the blurb on the back of the DVD's hard case was written by another marketing person who never watched it either; e.g., it is untrue that Freya ""must undertake a deadly battle when her father and fiance are captured by a tormented monster . . . cast out by his people."" Nor is it true that ""the Beast [singular] . . . battles with Freya for his redemption."" Further, expect no truth in these grand-sounding words: ""Prepare for the ultimate tale of love and sacrifice, damnation and salvation."" BTW, the front of the hard case has a fake sepia picture of Jane March/Freya shooting an arrow in an impossible manner: the arrow's shaft is two or three inches ABOVE her hand that's gripping the bow. With one exception, the acting is a perfect match for the script: laughably poor. The exception is the Beast (played by David Dukas). One is tempted to quip that only this role has ""teeth""; the fact is that only his role permits audio engineers (or whoever) to enhance the actor's voice electronically, only his role required serious make-up, and only his role required a ""special effect"" (his morphing back to Agnar, which every semi-conscious viewer, by a third of the way into the film, knew was coming). Other viewers have commented on the comical tropical setting of this Viking saga and the laughable ""ships."" Most preposterous is the tiny skiff that Freya and Ingrid (Candice Hillebrand) use to rescue King Thorsson (Greg Melvill-Smith). On the island, the Beast possesses an iron cage (which clearly has been welded together using 20th- or 21st-century equipment); when the king is confined in it, it can only be secured from the outside--and yet, when Freya is put inside it for her own protection at night, only she has control of its locking device. How convenient. The costumes are also anacronistically interesting, but only Ms. March's deserve extended comment. When we first see her, she is wearing a little black Viking bikini as she swims with friends; then, besides flimsy chain mail, we see her in an array of gowns that seem to be fashoned from finely woven or knit fabrics--the final one being most noteworthy for its sequined molded push-up bra-top. Lest this review seem too harsh, a few individuals connected with this film deserve special mention for their outstanding contributions: Mark Thomas, who composed the Viking music; Rob Bishop, one of the focus pullers; Ryan Lotter and Steven Ndlovu, two clapper loaders; Andrew Gribble, a grip; Ben Phiri, the generator operator; Guy Bonner, transport manager; Johannes Sithole, fabrication assistant; Kirsty Taylor, prosthetics; Maxmillian van der Merwe, standby set dresser; Dirk Knoesen, stand-by [sic] carpenter; Sally van der Merwe, scenic artists [sic]; Janine Wyatt-Mair, stunt performer; Grace Sibiyo, seamstress; Diane Allen, hair supervisor; Bianca, trainee make-up assistant; Ian Thysse, medic; and Mark Ferda, who did double duty as both dialogue editor AND re-recording mixer. Oh, one more thing: after coming out of her cage in the morning, Jane March SEEMS to have a nude swim in the sea, which the poor Beast views from hiding, far-far-far away"	0
this comedy, like Click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through. the characters in this film can be hated at points, especially Michael Douglas' and Matt Dillon's but there is a lighter side! Owen Wilson is very likeable as Dupree, an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job. the cast is fine and one of the strength's in this film! however, I think it gets too serious at points. this is supposed to be a comedy after all. I wouldn't buy it but it is certainly worth renting	1
"Maybe it's because I had never read the book and never heard of Hunter S. Thompson before this movie, but I found this movie to be unbearably boring and so utterly pointless!At what point in the movie-making process while reading the script aloud, did they realize that this isn't a movie?  Or maybe that the book couldn't be made into a commercial movie?The ""story"" if it can be called such, is apparently about a journalist and his fat hispanic friend (called his lawyer) who go to Las Vegas to write an article on some motorcycle race of some sort or something.  That's completely irrelevant, because probably 5-10 minutes is actually spent on that subject, with an additional 20 minutes at most devoted to the guy actually trying to accomplish the task.The rest is just Johnny Depp as the main character rambling mindlessly about a variety of subjects, most of which deal with drugs, or drug-related things.  Others having nothing at all to do with anything.  They are quite literally taking every drug known to mankind, and the movie chronicles them taking drugs.There are some scenes in which the duo are in their hotel room, where the ""lawyer"" freaks out in a bathtub and threatens to kill himself.  In other scenes, they are in the hotel club, or at a restaurant.  No matter where they are, they are always high on some drug, and Johnny Depp's character (Thompson himself based on his experience, under a fake name) is rambling or talking very very quickly and nonsensically.There are cameos by minor celebrities, some of which are world famous today.  Gary Busey is on screen for all of three or four minutes as a highway sheriff who sexually harrasses JD's character.  Tobey Maguire is on even less as a hitchhiker who bails out of the car when he realizes the duo are stoned out of their mind and crazy.The only moment in which I had a great laugh was in the beginning, where they are hallucinating that they are being attacked by bats as they drive down a desert highway.  When the ""lawyer"" stops to pick up the hitchhiker, JD's char says ""We can't stop here!  This is bat country!"".  That line and its delivery alone deserve the movie its one miserable star.  I expected better from Terry Gilliam.If this movie was attempting to be shocking or pro- or anti-drug or stylish or artistic in some way, it is obviously only a most acquired taste, like a group of people who think consuming waste is an acquired taste.  There is no moral message here, nothing pro- or anti-drug, nothing shocking save that these two aren't dead by the third day from taking so many drugs, or stylish or artistic.Not the worst movie ever, but definitely one of them.  I don't know what orifice people pull this ""great movie"" idea out of, but I'd like to examine that, and find out why"	0
Melanie Griffith, Rachel Leigh Cook, and Hugh Dancy star in this straight-to-video film about one female transporter, who gets into trouble because of someone plotting against her.  Well, that's all about it, apparently, but the film tries to give something unique to the otherwise unoriginal plot.I mean, the slightly original character of Sarah by Melanie Griffth, who plays that smuggler in trouble.  Given a special job by Malcom McDowell with his customary 'I-could-be-very-baaaad' smile, Sarah agrees to carry a pack hidden in her bag.  But as you know, someone also wants that package, and ... well, that's nothing new, but she is attacked on the way.DON'T EXPECT ANY THRILLER, however.  The film's focus is not about that; it is the relations about Sarah and Jack (Dancy) who live together in a fancy Paris apartment.  But while Sarah is away from Paris on business, Jack is attracted to a younger lady Jenny (Cook) who also falls for him.  Thus the film makes an effort to include both love and crime.  Nice try, considering this interesting point about the character of elder lady Sarah, but if the factor is taken away from the film, the end result is nothing but a flat, tired suspence -- suspence as to its relations and its crimes alike.  Either way, the film is emotilnally very void.OK. two fatally bad things: one, too incredible characters.  See, Sarah is a professional courier who must know the rules of the job, which could be dangerous.  But instead of renting a car (and it's Europe, where that could be pretty easy),  she takes a train (and a night train!) in which she becomes an  easy target.  In this way, the film misses every chance to make it more suspenceful.  When some character(s) must die, they die like characters in old video games -- they fall, that's all.      The other one; acting.  Let me be honest.  It was painful to watch the one-dimentional performance of Melanie Griffith, who was very good in 'Another Day in Paradise.'  Maybe she is not the greatest actor, but certainly she can act.  But as far as 'Tempo' is concerned, no, I don't think so.Only the location of Paris saves this film from utter forgettableness.  Forget about this one.                  	0
"I was more than impressed by this stupendous documentary.  Not only is it superior, photogrqphically speaking -- not only does it have beautiful & inspiring music -- it is factual and should open our eyes to what we have to lose in the name of oil!  We need to understand why environmentalists and educated elected officials care about protecting this pristine area. I was born, raised and educated in one of the most beautiful places in the U.S. in Boulder, CO -- at the foot of the flatirons -- BUT I truly feel this Alaska wilderness is ""God's Country.""  Buy this DVD -- view it -- invite everyone you care about to view it with you.  You wll begin to care and maYbe -- just maybe -- you will help to preserve it for your children & generations after you are gone"	1

I was surprised to have learn of this very old live performance by Cat Stevens (his name then).  I was well pleased with the quality of the performance format and of the tunes selection.  I was, and still am, a fan of his music.  Nice to see a dvd concert of his.  It is old music, but if you're a fan of the man, you'll enjoy it	1
"This ""Special Addiction"" DVD of ""Reefer Madness from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment is truly awesome!!!

Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!"	1

Sandra Bullock gives an outstanding and believable performance in the role of Angela Bennett.  In this film she plays the part of a solitary and lonely computer expert. An online hacker friend calls to tell her he's found an amazing disk and is sending it to her to check out.  Unfortunately, he's killed in a plane crash before he can visit her. The disk turns out to have secret government information and is wanted by a terrorist group who plan the downfall of the U.S. government. Angela Bennett recognizes that the disk is something special and before she really realizes what she has, she finds that she's being stalked. What happens next is everyone's worst nightmare. Through the miracle of computers, the evil group steal Angela's identify and there are few people to vouch for her. The story quickly turns into a cyber thriller.She tries to get help, but she appears to have no friends and doesn't even know her own neighbors. Her mother (Diane Baker) is in an institution and is apparently suffering from Alzheimer's.  Her former boyfriend, played by Dennis Miller does try to help her, but the forces of evil are difficult to hide from. Jeremy Northam delivers a spine tingling performance as the charming and mysterious Jack Devlin. A man you really want to trust, but should you?  	1
This film does not come close to the quality of Once Upon a Time in China. First of all, the plot is weak, it does not have the kind of power that the original of this series did. The characters in this film seem like they are out of a comic book, while the characters in the first film were interesting and complex. The kungfu is mostly unrealistic wirework, and while Once Upon a Time in China had some of this, the emphasis was on realistic martial arts. In the original, the main characters were trying to resist the influence of the West which was destroying their culture, but in this version, the main characters are actually on the side of the Westerners and they are fighting their own people! There is no explanation of why Wong Fei Hung and his crew would side with the people who were their enemies in the last film. One of the reasons the original film was so good, was because it was about brave Chinese patriots trying to protect their culture, but in this film is seems as though they have switched sides	0
I bought a couple of Bob vidoes through Amazon for my son, age nearly 2, who loves the series. We were crushingly disappointed by these videos, though. The wonderful voices of the UK version (Neil Morissey et. al) have been replaced by American voices. WHY do they do that? For us it means the videos are unplayable because they just ain't Bob. British shoppers and anyone familiar with the original Bob should be warned. (Can I get my money back?	0
I don't like her routine in this DVD at all.  I don't like the strechie.  It's a completely waste and it won't give you the same workout as hand weights or balance ball.

"This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking ""Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?"" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!"	0
Burt Lancaster stars in this tough, grim noir-drenched prison flick, in which a sadistic prison guard (a young Hume Cronyn) manipulates tensions and weaknesses to produce an explosive situation.  The film's liberal message butts up against its obligatory &quot;crime never pays&quot; ending; the convicts are sympathetic, but doomed from the word &quot;go.&quot;  A little stagey and lurid, but overall tense and suspenseful -- the ending is a real nail-biter.  Recommended	1
"  This is the first movie I remember seeing as a kid.  I LOVED it.  It was my favorite.  Then, I didn't get to see it again for several years (stupid Blockbuster!)  When I finally saw it again, I STILL liked it.  I like it as I write this very day.  The music is good (the background music behind the movie that nobody really conciously listens to, but helps the mood anyway).  The animation's good, too.  And I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! (How often does that happen?)  See, what happens a lot of the time, is that people blame colors they don't like, or designs  that are annoying, or WHATEVER on the animation.  But it isn't the animation's fault!  The way the thing on-screen MOVES is the only thing the animators do, mostly.  So, if you really want to criticize the animation, look at how they MOVE, not what they look like. Do you see?   I think that, really, most of the reason that this is one of my favorite movies is that it is about BOOKS.  When I was little, my dad read me ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" and ""The Hobbit""; things like that.  So, naturally, I loved books and stories.  This is practically the only movie I've seen that encourages reading so much while still being sincere.  It's obvious that the filmmakers themselves (or at least, a lot of the people working on it) actually like to read.  THAT'S really why I like the Pagemaster.     So, if you like to read, watch this movie.  If you don't (you utter nincompoop), stay away, and don't criticize what you have no comprehension of"	1

I was so pleased to find this movie on Amazon.com. I had watched it as a child and pinned over it when I could not find it in stores over the years. This is such a pure love story, with the main characters completely selfless and yet charmingly real. There are too few unpretentious, untampered romantic movies around these days. Most reveal too much- literally. But this one leaves you truly satisfied while lending pleasant modesty to a normally scandalous genre	1
"This movie was one of the most honest, accurate portrayals of how to play the dating ""game"" I have ever seen.  I liked it so much I bought it for my 15 year old son to give him pointers.  Ignore the tacked on Hollywood ending"	1
"""The Changeling"" has become a little bit dated, however, it is still a very good ghost story. The film stars (George C. Scott) as John Russell, a composer who has lost his family in a tragic accident. He rents a large estate in order to compose his music. It is here that he encounters the ghost of a young boy. Why is the boy haunting the estate? Why is he making contact with John Russell? As the film moves forward, John Russell contacts a medium and eventually begins to investigate the mansion.From what he can gather, it was the former home of Senator Carmichael (Melvin Douglas). What ensues is the mystery of who the child is, and who is Senator Carmichael. What occurred in the mansion that is keeping this child there? This is more of a mystery than a horror film. The suspense of the film is through the nuances the director created by use of creepy sounds and effects in which the boy's wheelchair moves. The film is dated, and does not have the appeal it once had for me, however, it is still a good watch. Recommended."	1
"Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker deliver once again in this follow-up to their great film ""Rush Hour"". This film follows on the premise of the first, with a bit of a reversal....this time Tucker is the fish out of water in Chan's Hong Kong.As with my review of Rush Hour, I'll say up front that if youre looking for anything more than a fun-filled actioner, then this movie wont please you. It breaks no new ground and the plot is quite formulaic, but if you're looking for deep drama and character development...what are you doing watching a Chris Tucker movie?Watch for a great cameo by Don Cheadle as a black man married to an asian woman who owns and runs a Chinese Soul Food restaurant in a black section of Los Angeles. That alone is worth a laugh. There is another stand-out cameo by Jeremy Piven as a gay clothing store clerk who mistakes them for a couple. Be sure to watch the end credits and catch all of Piven's ad-libbed outtakes that ended up on the cutting room floor. But then, as with all Jackie Chan films, half the fun is watching the flubs during the end credits"	1
"Tihs DVD truly has incredible camerawork, and fully illustrates the intelligence and beauty of dolphins, but some things people don't realize about dolphins kept in captivity need to be told.  PLEASE take the time to read this.Many dolphins you see in aquariums and swim-with programs and circuses around the world often come from brutal drive hunts, during which dolphins are rounded up into very tight nets concealing them, and are dragged ashore making it easier to violently wrestle them into slings.  These dolphins captured, while they may be smiling in appearance (which is the way their faces were genetically designed), are ripped away from their beloved podmates and torn from their environment.  How would you like to be a dolphin who once lived in a vast sea of blue and then suddenly be taken into a shallow pool of water, forced to live with the loud sounds of people screaming, the filtration system running, and very little space to swim?In the process of capturing dolphins for human entertainment, many die in the process.  Stress severely affects a dolphin's body, and many suffer irreperable damage to their hearts in the execution.  On top of that, dependent calves (baby dolphins) who have spent the entirety of their lives with their mothers, often get torn from them, leaving them helpless, even if they are released.  While you can clearly see in the film that many of the dolphins appear to be having fun, would it not be too much to consider the fact that they might miss their former companions?  Are they really happier stuck in a cement tank forced to perform tricks in order to be fed?  Keep this in mind the next time you visit an aquarium or swim-with program.  For dolphins captured in Japan, the industry has been given permits to slaughter a number of them needlessly in the process by the government.I believe this film spends too little time in the beginning addressing the human threat to dolphins.  Over 7,000,000 dolphins have died at the hands of humans since the late 1950s.  I think a few minutes at the beginning of the film doesn't nearly suit the need to inform the audience of the issue.  Tuna fisheries, whose products are falsely labeled as ""dolphin-safe"" (there are established 'KILL MINIMUMS' now for tuna companies) need to be exposed.  Intentional killings in Japan (especially), South America, and all over the world need to be publicized.  But I also understand that this is a family film, mainly, but I think it is also important to inform young viewers of the problems dolphins face with humans.  They are the ones who will need to make the difference in the future.Please just remember this next time you watch this film.  While dolphins are valued by many, they are targeted by many as well as a way of easy money-making.This film is more of a sugar-coated production, although it certainly is beautiful, as are the dolphins seen in the flim.  I would recommend a film entitled ""Dolphin Defender"" for those who seek some informative footage behind the scenes to what really happens to dolphins in drive hunts."	1
So I decided maybe I'll give this exploitation thing a try considering I love gore,violence, and horror movies. The reason I give it a 1 star is because it just isn't that good of a movie. It's VERY boring for most of the movie. About the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said. Then the guys just rape this woman several times, then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge. It's very slow paced and doesn't live up to the hype. It isn't all that gory, and it isn't scary either. Also, the rape isn't that convincing. I'm not saying I need everything shown in detail, but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal. Oh, and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her...and he was practically mentally retarded. The guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad. That is not grounds for what she did to him, which in my opinion was the worst of the killings. Anyways. not that good of a movie, don't let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not	0
If you must see a cannibal film stick to Cannibal Holocaust. the grindhouse release is well worth the money. However the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful. The picture quality is horrendous. The movie is lacking any redeemable quality. There are a few violent moments, but just a few. One of the absolute worst italian horror/exploitation films made. If Cannibal Holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films, then ferox is the plan 9.	0
In a movie such as this, only James Cameron could do it justice. This documentary follows one of the most haunting disasters in the history of sea travel, and for that reason, everything had to be perfect and it was. The special effects are unparalleled, and the intricacy of the technological advances only exemplifies the rest of the good points of the movie. This probably could have gotten the remaining 0.5 points (going by the KAB scale, of course), except I was really hoping that the filmmakers would have explored the stern section of the ship, which, I believe was supposed to be located a half mile away from the bow section.The KAB score: 9.5	1

"I saw this movie for one reason: I wanted to see Gerard Butler in something other than Phantom Of The Opera just to see how he played a ""normal"" role. I've never been a big fan of ""chick flicks"" (for instance, my friend and I watched A Walk To Remember awhile ago, and the only thing that kept us from laughing throughout was the constant threat of being slapped by one of the girls in the room). That said, Dear Frankie is a thoroughly entertaining film that has a surprisingly deep plot and keeps going at a fast enough pace that you never get bored. Initially I had trouble understanding what the actors were saying (they all have thick accents), but once I got used to it I had no problems through the rest of the movie"	1
This edition of the film sucks and sucks again. The wide screen version of this is a Masterpiece - without the widescreen ratio this edition cannot be true to the comic book sensibility that Bava intended.  Each shot was carefully composed(and not intended to be butchered) - this edition is a travesty -- especially when it's purported to be put out by fans - do you're homework. There are also scenes missing from this print, scenes that are important and add to the overall ambience. Hey I thought the folks behind this were enthusiasts -- instead its just sloppy and self indulgent. Look for the earlier laser disc edition ........... as for the extras do we really need the - it's great because I used it in my video slop .... and it's great because I did a bad homage/rip-off slop. The documentary in the extras takes great pains to point out that this film was intended to look like a comic book and that's what was great about it. Then when you watch the film what you get is less than a third of the original image! Strikes me a total scumminess. All in a all a fabulous opportunity wasted ... by a few lazy lard-asses with a quick-fix mentality.	0
My first viewing of this film was a great disappointment.  I expected another Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy film, with Chevalier substituting for Eddy.  And I emphatically did not like the film.  Then I viewed the film a second time, this time with the play-by-play voice-over analysis by Miles Kreuger, which comes as a extra bonus on this DVD.  Suddenly I was seeing the film in a completely different light, and absolutely loving this film.  This DVD is an absolute gem, and one of the best things about it is the intelligent and articulate insights provided by Miles Kreuger, not confined to this film alone but applying to the cinema world at large in the early 30s.  It is as if a film critic from the 1930s had come back to life, as if he had actually been on the sets during the filming (because he's talked to those who were).  Kreuger's commentary alone is worth the price of this DVD.  After seeing this film for the first time, you must go back and see it again through Miles Kreuger's eyes.	1
"I bought the DVD hoping to see one skit -- the funniest one my family had ever seen on SNL. We had it recorded on VHS many MANY years ago and somehow lost it. But we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where Phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits -- ""Smiling Laughing Joking Around Man"" ... ""Man Who Reminds Me Of My Doggie"" ... ""Hair Head!""  I thought for SURE that THE funniest skit in all of SNL history would be on there, but no...it was just a 20 second clip. I was SO disappointed!! And it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety...They just weren't funny. On a positive note, there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the DVD that was so sweet, it brought me to tears. And the bonus featuring Phil's audition was quite interesting. But overall, I don't recommend it. "	0

Sorry I couldn't come up with a better punchline, but this movie doesn't deserve any original thought or ideas.  Maybe its because there aren't any original ideas in this movie event.

The presentation of computer enhanced b&w images that in some cases were sort of new added limited value to my extensive video library, legacy of my father.

"I have owned a copy of this film for a long time. I have probably watched it ten times, and I always tear up a little at each viewing. From the beginning newsreel, of a shell-shocked Diane Feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, to the final reel of Harvey Milk's prophetic and haunting statements, the viewer is mesmerized. Though Harvey Milk was a San Francisco city supervisor, his election in the 1970's, that of an open and unrepentant gay man, made national headlines . He was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere, who at that time were unrepresented and, for the most part, still forced into the closet. This film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of Harvey Milk, but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time. Milk was a very eloquent speaker, and his sensibility, logic, and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent. This is best displayed in the footage of his  debate with then California Senator Briggs, a buffoon like character, who not only was a terrible speaker, who couldn't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears, but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis Milk. The public view at that time was about family values, with the Anita Bryants condeming homosexuals to Hell for their decadent ways (Old times come round again....). Milk's voice opposed this view openly, and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented. The notion of this martyrdom, and its romantic though fateful attraction to Milk, has been argued. Nevertheless, his bravery in representing the unrepresented cannot be argued, and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message, nor the admiration he deserves. This film unfolds as it happened, seeming like fiction, but all too real. As Milk is assassinated, along with the Mayor, by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor Dan White, whose subsequent trial, with the famous ""Twinkie Defense"", and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders, resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen. As one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation,... if only the Mayor had been killed, White would have gotten life, but the fact that Milk, a gay man, had also been killed, leaned public sympathy  towards White, an absurd but all too realistic conclusion.There are many moving, telling, historically signifigant moments in this film, but none so clearly represents those times, and Milk's loss and legacy, as the film of the nighttime march in San Francisco right after the murders. Seas of people, holding candles and standing silently, came together in a very moving moment in time. This film, which won best documentary at that years Oscars, transcends its subject matter, and is simply a great documentary. Gay rights have made much progress. And perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all, excluding those who were there, are old enough to remember , or are gay.  Nonetheless, Harvey Milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement, and his legacy, through schools named after him, organizations, and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless, lives on."	1
I saw this movie on t.v. for the first time a few days ago and now I'm buying the DVD. I'm not a big fan of action movies but I do watch them now and again. I've read quite a few negative reviews about this film and I think they are undeserved. When I saw it I thought it was good, not Diehard good, but it held its own. I really enjoyed it. I really liked the idea that they included a female member of SWAT. One never sees a woman SWAT member. It looks like this is one of those movies you either love, like, or hate. One has to make up one's own mind	1
"Damn. There's nothing remarkable about the second item on this DVD; it's your standard European-made sexploitation film. ""The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield,"" on the other hand, is reprehensible. It's a hodge-podge of vacation footage of Mansfield, clips from her movie project, and material entirely unrelated to Mansfield, linked only by the voiceover... and then, after an hour or so of light-hearted softcore buffoonery, the movie cuts to her death, spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large, mostly empty mansion she has left behind.This movie has the feel of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off a famous name after Mansfield's death. This is exploitation in its worst form. I found the sudden change in tone, the large volume of non-Mansfield material, and the sheer obsessiveness of the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme. Those looking for cheesy bad movies to enjoy, or softcore porn to tittilate, go elsewhere; this one is not merely bad, but evil"	0
"For those of you who only saw the new film last year (I bought it with this sight unseen because it looked interesting and it allowed me to get my favorite free shipping deal) here's your chance to see the Original stories of Flicka and her son Thunderhead.  These 3 films which I am told are pretty faithful to Mary O'Hara's novels of the same titles (I have them too but never read them).  The main difference between them and the 2006 remake is that is the central character is named ""Ken (rather thank Katy McLaughlin"", well at least the kept the same name in the remake) and is played by a young Roddy McDowell in the first 2 films and Robert Arthur in the third.  The reason he probably didn't do ""Green Grass"" is that the same year (1948) he was making the second big screen version of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped.  The first film was released on VHS years ago, and both the first 2 had been previously released on DVD to celebrate their 60th anniversaries.  Unfortunately those discs are out of print, albeit some Amazon sellers are still offering them separately or together.  But the copies in this set are exactly the same discs, except for the pictures on the jackets and the labels on the discs.  The text on the back of the boxes and list of chapter stops (on the lists and discs) are exactly the same as the previous releases.  This is also the only way to get all 3 (if you don't count the old copies) as only the first film has been re-released as a separate item (it also marks the first appearance of ""Green Grass"" on video in any way, shape or form).  By the way, it was also made into the a short lived tv series in 1956 which I doubt we will ever see again.  If you like the books and movies of Anna Sewell's Black Beauty and Walter Farley's Black Stallion and the 2006 remake interests (or interested you), get this set before they go out of print again."	1
Sure, the pacing is slow compared to today's hyper/cyber entertainments, but Antonioni's visuals are still incomparable.  Scene after scene resembles nothing so much as a Matisse canvas, and the final shot is a  stunner.  Lovely, achingly felt picture	1
I love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn't carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better	0
"The film seems to focus on 70's punk exclusively.  Anything post-1980 is glossed over, clumped together and generally viewed with dissapointment by this ""documentary"".  I think the film does well documenting the roots of punk, seeing as how Letts was steeped in the scene at that time (although The Misfits weren't mentioned, which I found odd).  The interviews with Henry Rollins and Jello Biafra were great as well.  However, in order to claim to be a documentary, the evolution of punk rock is just as integral (perhaps more so) as its origins.  I think, basically, Letts based the film on his own opinions, likes and dislikes instead of actually documenting punk.  I was disapointed.       "	0
"This is a great DVD.  I bought it for my son, who has Special Needs.  He attends a lot of dances and is always on the dance floor, but has never been able to figure out how to do the Electric Slide or Macarena.  Neither my husband nor I knew how to do these dances either.  I played the ""Party Line Dances"" DVD, and asked my son to follow Shawn's instructions.  Pretty soon he was moving along with Shawn, and doing very well.  And by joining a few of our son's practices, my husband and I quickly picked up the dance moves too.  My son now participates fully, and we look forward to line dancing at our own occasions"	1
"(4.5/5 stars)  Exceptional envisioning of the Batman comic book by Tim Burton. Michael Keaton brings an understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a disturbed soul and dual personality. Contrast this with the unbridled mania of the character in ""Batman Begins;"" both are equally effective, though one style over the other will likely appeal to you. Is there any topping Jack Nicholson in his role as Jack Napier / The Joker? Only he can pull off such an exaggerated performance and have it be so fun without ruining a movie. Even though his role is suitably funny, there is a little too much humor overall in the movie. Robert Wuhl's character is especially unnecessarily comical. Also, while Danny Elfman's score is duly heroic and compelling, the music by Prince just doesn't mesh well and is probably not the best choice. Nonetheless, the visuals are stunning, the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining. It is a testament to the film's influence that numerous comic book movies have subsequently used Danny Elman scores (including rival Marvel's ""Spider-Man"") and molded black rubber suits, though this film also owes much to 1978's ""Superman"" with its realistic approach and A-list villains. Great stuff."	1

"After I saw the first two ""Scary Movies"" I decided too see this movie. I thought the Wayans brothers were the two writers, but I can see that I was wrong. This movie is a spoof with no plot and no good jokes. I could hardly understand anything in this movie at all without giving my self a headache! I myself, a teen, which this movie appealed too did not find this funny. I don't know why teens like this movie so much. -Ben Russell"	0
"Awhile ago I was having a conversation with someone about musical tastes where we vastly disagreed on what was simply awesome bands and which ones were purely based around taste, such as people who love R&B and Rap to people who prefer Dance. In a way, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, as well as the Exorcist and the Shining are like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin of horror movies: you must love them and say anything different and you're going to get lynched. So I will agree that the film is definately refreshing considering the latest crop of so-called ""horror movies"", yet at the same time I wonder why it didn't hit me that much.5 kids are travelling through the country and hear of a couple of houses. They decide to check it out only no one's home...seemingly at first. Pretty soon they meet Leatherface, a man in a burlap sac mask who wields a big fat chainsaw. Pretty soon, the kids start going one by one and we find a family seriously depraved and having to escape alive. It's odd how I can't say any more about the plot; not because of spoilers but because there's not a lot else to say.Like many a filmgoer, I can't stand the latest releases in horror. Instead of using atmosphere, pacing and mood to creep people out, they go for broke and show some of the more violent scenes. This film isn't even gory at all. In fact, the film's goriest scene, where one of the kids meets a chainsaw, isn't even shown onscreen. Your mind fills in what went on which can probably be even more disturbing. Adding to the realism is that it's shot in a kind of documentary-like style. One problem I had with the film was that the dread didn't feel there. There was pre-MTV style editing and extreme-closeups of eyeballs and maybe I've just seen it before but it didn't creep me out like it should've(and having a woman scream for 20 minutes doesn't help).If I saw this in 1974, I mostly likely would've been creeped out of my wits but seeing it 32 years later, it's more like ""yeah it was alright although I better not say so cause then everybody will bug me about it"". If you're a fan, go ahead and buy it because it's probably the best release of the film but personally, I'm not"	1
"Like many of the reviewers here, I am an Anne Rice fan. However, I knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them. I mean, few of the ""Dracula"" movies throughout the years have had anything to do with Bram Stoker's novel. All I wanted - and expected - was a flashy, no substance guilty pleasure movie, a la ""Dracula 2000."" That alone should tell you my expectations.But QotD failed even as a guilty pleasure. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense when taken on it's own, and the acting was bad to bland. I also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires. Rice's vampires are supposed to be beautiful, whereas this bunch looked like Eurotrash or people at a Halloween spook house.However, one good thing about this movie is the music videos for Lestat. SInce the videos are included on the DVD, it earns 1 star"	0
"Great improvements over the original DVD. Enhanced for 16x9 TVs with scenes that are now clearer and actually 2.35:1 widescreen ratio.  The original dvd claims an aspect ratio of ""approximately 2.35:1"" which was not true. I own both versions and have compared viewing aspects  of each. Clearly this DVD is far superior and well worth the purchase price.  This plays very well on my HDTV monitor; I'll give the old version to someone w/ an old 4x3 TV. "	1

Not a fan of graphic novels or CGI, I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but found it to be so well written, cast and shot that I will no doubt buy it for my collection. It's a dark movie, subversive really, but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people, that one strong person with a will, determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them, can turn the tide. It's a powerful message, and it's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery, symbolism and script. Bravo	1
This is not a review of this item, but the whole series.  Not only are the films in this bundle not all musicals, this bundle is sent intstead of the purchased bundle.  Until Amazon straightens out the mess in titles, forget ordering Alice Faye and Betty Grable bundles:  Particularly MARQUEE MUSICALS.	0
This movie was the first DVD I ever bought!  It is truly a gem.  I like the Infinifilm bonus features.  (It may not have been called Infinifilm at this time.)  Brett Ratner is truly a comedic genius, and really gives the customer great quality DVD's.  The movie is funny and interesting enough.  I enjoyed the scenes in several different locales.  I enjoyed the physical interactions between Jackie and Chris Tucker.  I think the stunts were wonderfully orchestrated.  Jackie Chan is a genius at physical comedy.I highly recommend this DVD.Two thumbs up!!!MC White said:  Check it out!!!	1
"I love this movie it is a ""comfort"" movie for me as this was one of my favs as a kid and I still love it today"	1
"Hands down the worst episode of the Masters Of Horror television show. It's dull, boring, and not scary. It will leave you scratching your head saying ""that's all?"" Don't even bother with this dvd. It's a waste of your precious time."	0
"For those not aware, Pumpkinhead 2 is (supposedly) the 1994 sequel to 1988's timeless monster classic, Pumpkinhead. The original was darkly creepy, superbly constructed in it's story, and featured a wonderfully original costume for the creature. Pumpkinhead 2 fails at being slightly horrorific, butchers the story, and basically uses the name and a simliar creature-suit to create an otherwise completely irrelevant ""sequel"". It's like a group of writers saw a picture of Pumpkinhead on the internet, read his name (and that's ALL they read), and decided to make their own movie. As for the plot (if anyone cares), a deformed boy dies and comes back as a monster to exact revenge on the people who hurt his feelings. I'll admit, if they had altered the look of the creature a bit and had chosen a different name for the movie, this would've been worth two or three stars as a ""so bad it's good"" B flick. But the fact that they totally butchered the original by attempting to connect this garbage to it really kills it. If you haven't seen 1988's Pumpkinhead, rent it or buy it -- it's a horror masterpiece (especially compared to this) with so much going for it. But avoid this sequel at all costs. I hate to put down any product, but I feel that this one deserves it"	0

Tom Cruise gives an excellent performance as IMF agent Ethan Hunt,who is framed for murder after the death of his IMF team.Together with the help of two other IMF agents,Hunt sets out to find the real murderer.Cornered most of the movie and set to his limits,Hunt and team are hard put to catch the assailants.It all leads to a final showdown on a speeding bullet train with an unlikely foe.Hard core action and awesome intellegence meet in this exhillirating action drama by filmmaker Brian DePalma	1
What's wrong with this show?1.  Jim wears the same pants, coat, and shirt for almost every episode throughout the entire run of the series.     2.  A slow, sluggish middle-aged man is supposed to outdo younger hoodlums.  3.  Won't that woman lawyer ever get a real boyfriend that will do right by her?4.  Do you really believe that this middle-aged, heavy fellow would drive a Firebird - a tight fitting car?5.  Angel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
i love this movie.  it's picture perfect in a life of a tweeker and their enviroment.WHERE IS THE SOUNDTRACK TO THIS MOVIE?????	1
"This just to voice my opinion on the new RAN transfer. While I agree it is an improvement over the atrocious Fox Lorber edition (which is not that great an achievement considering the Fox Lorber DVD was one of the worst products in the history of home entertainment), this tranfer is still a long way from doing this masterpiece justice. Yes, the colors are vivid but the sharpness and definition are exceptionally poor and the heavy edge enhancement (straight from hell!) doesn't make it any better. I have seen transfers of movies that are some 30 or 40 years older than RAN but look far better. The problem becomes very obvious when one watches this DVD via progressive component output on a large screen - a video tape was used as a master (and a poor one at that). The only way to restore such an important movie properly and thereby finally showing Mr. Kurosawa the respect he deserves would have been to make a direct digital transfer off an original film negative, before applying filters or any enhancements. Why this opportunity was (again) wasted here escapes me totally and angers me very much. Another problem seems to be the excessive use of noise reduction on the video, which is in part responsible for the poor definition of the transfer. For my part, I would much sooner live with a bit of visible film grain and the odd dust speckle than to have a such a ""saucy"" soft picture without much ""bite"" and detail. There is no excuse for posting such an objectively false statement. And yes, the packaging is a liability - my DVDs must have been bobbing about in there all the way across the Atlantic and looked accordingly. Shocking. I would have gladly payed twice the price if they had kept all the cards and posters and instead got the most important thing right: the image quality of RAN. Like this, I'm very disappointed"	0
Noel and Liam and Jarvis are f*&king hilarious...Damon needs to off himself...same with the weirdo journalist with the upper-class accent...this video is good at making Britpop seem like an actual period in music...hahahahaha...whatever...besides, everyone knows Radiohead and Prodigy were quite accepted in the U.S. and were very original...Oasis is an awesome, lethal rock n roll band, anyone who loves rock n roll have to love Oasis...don't cheat yourself..	1
Seriously: the sound is the worst I have encountered on any DVD release, a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles - there is a lot of video jittery things going on, it all adds up to my conclusion that the DVD version is transfered from a very, very bad analog copy. On top of all, the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled. Dont buy this unless you are a fanatic WKW fan who already own all other releases.....	0
This was a great movie for me because my daughter did this dance routine in a school production 15 years ago and we both wanted to see the movie over and over again	1
This is my favorite toning workout and I'm sure to incorporate it into my routine for my once a week tone-fest. What I like best about it is that I can customize it to whatever body part I think needs the most work this week. Need a 30 minute ab workout? You can choose it. Think the arms and legs need work? No problem. Want to tone a little bit of everything? You can do that, too.The instructors are all good - clear, not irritating, and they come up with some unique exercises to work each body part - it's not your standard crunches for ab work on this video. This was one of my best purchases, workout-wise. I wish there were more DVD's/workouts out there with Minna Lessig - she is my favorite instructor (she does the arm/leg workouts on this DVD). The other two instructors are wonderful as well - and the workout just seems to fly by, although at the end you do know you've worked those muscle groups.	1
A film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it. The story is simple enough, and not a whole lot happens. But there's no denying it, this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way. It's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers, and that the film doesn't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience. Not one charachter is stereotyped. They are human, and they'll probably remind you of people you know. I applaud this kind of a movie, and I wish there would be more of them	1
This film is boring, so much so that I could only take 35 minutes of it before I was forced to push stop. This is a soap opera about politics & oil companies. It's weird jump around style is confusing & pointless...do yourself a favor and don't bother w/ this garbage	0
"I will be honest I like Dolph Lundgren.........a look at his filmography you see B.movie classics such as ""The Punisher"",Universal Soldier"" and ""Blackjack"" Dolph has been going trough a slump.........Storm Catcher and the startlingly routine Jill The Ripper and the awful Minion(AKA Fallen Knight) but with Agent Red Dolph Lundgren hits rock bottom. Agent Red first of all steals it's music from Predator 2......and it's plot from Counter Measures,Oh I'm not finished yet. It steals footage from Storm Catcher!!!!!!!!! The scene where Jon Penner steals the  air craft while posing as Dolph Lundgren..........Now Penner is 5'11 Dolph Lundgren is 6'5 for goodness sake! yet they try to pass it off as Dolph Lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission.....This scene made me wanna throw up but I hung in there.....It turns out more footage is stolen.......I swear I saw footage from Iron Eagle  and Iron Eagle II.......I saw footage from Crimson Tide and I saw footage from Counter Measures........What the heck was Dolph thinking when he signed for this junk? I have no idea. When I was a teen (When Showdown In Little Tokyo came out) I thought Dolph Lundgren couldn't sink lower then Showdown In Little Tokyo,Then when I saw The Minion I was almost sure Dolph couldn't do worse........Well I pray he can't do any worse because Agent Red is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life..........This is coming from a guy who likes Don The Dragon Wilson. Bottomline:On Agent Red's cover it says ""Once exposed you cannot survive""  Take this as a warning"	0
I did not have any of the original trilogy on DVD.  I am happy to have the theatrical releases as I am not a fan of the SE's, particularly Jedi.  I was nervous due to bad reviews, but they look and sound great.  If you like Star Wars and want the original releases I highly recommend these.  If you already happily own the SE's or are feeling cheated or robbed in some way by repeated releases of the same movie, then don't buy these. 	1
You want the greatest zombie film ever made in the most deluxe version DVD possible today? Buy this set today, as it includes 3 versions of the film, including Argento's take on the film, known as Zombi: Dawn of the Dead.Dawn of the Dead has that 79 feel, with wide camera shots that allow the characters to breathe, unlike so many modern horror flicks that smother the stars with endless closeups.The zombie gore is to be noted, as its quite gory near the end of the film and at some parts throughout, but no real feasting occurs till the end, for the ultimate payoff. Yes, the zombies are pasty and fresh, since the outbreak has just began, which joins a team of four who struggle to survive in a mall while the world is quickly overtaken in this, Dawn of the Dead, easily the strongest Romero entry, and amongst ALL zombie films	1
"If you liked ""Raise the Red Lantern"" or ""The Last Emperor"",this is a perfect movie.Gong Li,who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband's affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband.""Farewell My Concubine"" uses Chinese opera as a way of telling the story.I used to listen to a lot of Chinese opera--which is an acquired taste.This movie uses the story of a king&his beloved concubine's self-sacrifice to frame the love story between two men.When one of the men falls in love with and marries a woman,the stage is set for a tragic love triangle.The final scenes are chilling,powerful.This is a spectacle not to be missed"	1
"Having only seen Seinfeld's series on TV that goes by the same name, it was great to have the opportunity to see him as a stand up comedian on DVD.I'd never seen the DVD before, but some of the material sounded familiar... Perhaps it overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are shown on the Seinfeld show?You may notice that in his speel about the Chinese he lets the word ""shovel"" out too soon (when talking about the Chinese's perseverance with chopsticks), and thus spoils the joke a little bit.  But Seinfeld is obviously a master of ad lib, so he managed to work around it.A thoroughly recommendable DVD"	1
"Well you know the drill. Some people will like anything that is ""artsy"" or ""out of the ordinary"" or ""made by that great director"". Its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless.The movie is about incest. It is about sex and adolescence. And, ironically, it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews. The best part of this movie is Eva Green. Or, more precisely, Eva Green's body. I didn't care about her acting (I thought it was mediocre). I just sat there and drunk her body in, wishing that I was that lucky actor (whats his name again?). The only reason to watch this movie is Eva Green. If she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation, then I am glad it happened. The movie is visually rich. In fact, its so rich that Bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see. But I will take it. He captures and celebrates Eve Green's stunning body - every square millimeter of it(including her genitals - the movie is NC17 for a reason), to perfection. Other than that, there is nothing else in the movie. The story is utterly insipid, the old movie clips, the ""discussion"" of morality or whatever ... nothing interesting. The music is another plus point.Bottomline, watch it for Eva Green's body. It deserves five stars. But the movie deserves only two"	0
"WOW! What more can I say! Just watching this was an absolutely extraordinary experience. This is a ""behind the scenes"" look at photography. It gets you up close and personal with the photographers and lets you know what is involved in trying to capture the ""shot of a lifetime"". I own many National Geographic books, but you won't be able to appreciate what goes into each photograph without watching this DVD. Even those who are not interested in photography will be able to appreciate it"	1
My 2 year old loves his video. The animations are unusual but they are full of flare, color and imagination. The songs they include are by far the best part and my daughter can't get enough of them. The main character Moustache, and the rest of the characters, are all well imagined and fun. As far as the learning experience my daughter loves to repeat the phrases and sing the songs and I see her using what she has learned all the time, and the semi-interactive format they use really gets her involved in the story line. I personally love this video and would recommend it	1
Maybe this is not fair, to write a review without even seeing the DVD.  I wanted to make sure Disney understands that people do read these reviews, and I am not buying this DVD, as Swamp Fox is incomplete!  Three out of Eight episodes is hardly a reason to purchase	0
Is a bad sequel and have a poor quality of special effects	0
The movie has a great story. Unlike Streetfighter Alpha the Movie, Alpha Generations actually follows the correct storyline. It had the potential to be a great movie, but there is to much wrong with it that cannot be overlooked that will irritate you immediately. The character design sucks(Why dosen't Ryu look like Ryu?), the English voice acting sucks(I recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles) and the fights suck. The only fight worth watching during the whole movie is Ryu vs. Sakura. This film dosen't even deserve a 1 star rating. I just gave it that because there's no way to go lower	0
"The slick stylish Spanish thriller ""Nobody Knows Anybody"" is set in Seville during Holy Week in the year 2000. Newspaper crossword puzzle developer and would-be writer Simon Cardenas (Eduardo Noriega) is struggling as usual with his novel when he receives a cryptic telephone message ordering him to use the word ""adversary"" as an answer to an upcoming crossword clue. Since the message also contained threats, Simon does what he's told, and he soon finds himself embroiled in a nightmarish sequence of events. Directed by Mateo Gil, ""Nobody Knows Anything"" opens with a scene of a man stabbed to death with a crucifix through his heart, and this scene is one of the ideas that feeds the notion you are about to see some sort of horror film with religious overtones, but the plot moves away from the horror aspect into straight thriller territory. The film--which owes much of its style to American thrillers--is slickly produced, and the exotic settings of the sights and sounds of Seville help, but the preposterous plot with its huge gaps in logic and implausibility ultimately left this viewer disappointed and feeling a bit cheated by the experience. I was intrigued at first by the film and drawn into the plot. However, once the plot and the mystery aspect became clear (and I can't give away too much here), the film became silly and trite. There's little character development--our hero is a flat, dull passive character, and the film's emphasis is on the thrill aspect. A slick product that is ultimately empty and really ridiculous, this film is in Spanish with English subtitles--displacedhuma"	0
I love the History Channel, have infinite respect for the AVG, love John Wayne films, and lived two years in the part of China where Flying Tigers is set.  So, you'd think I might adore this film?  I had hoped so, but unfortunately Republic pictures made this opus on the cheap.John Wayne plays a fictional commander of the American Volunteer Group, somewhere between Claire Chennault and Pappy Boygnton.  He does his best to carry the film, and does OK, but he can't carry it alone.  Bad effects, cheap stock footage, flimsy sets, and bad script all plague TIGERS.Republic made little effort to hide the California filming location and even used the WRONG PLANES!  There is little mention of the OSS-AVG connection, and the film was made too early on to be a good history of the AVG, even if it were accurate.The heroes of the AVG deserve better than TIGERS; this film isn't a tribute to them, it's a sloppy, propaganda film that does them little service	0
The Little Rascals collection is a set of 5 DVDs with a few shorts on each DVD, the fifth disk with an extra from the 50s and a documentary about child stars. This set was poorly put together, the shorts included are quite random, and buying this set would be a waste of money.Each disk opens with a montage of some of the characters. First there is Alfalfa, then Buckwheat, Spanky, Darla, Porky, Mickey, Stymie, then Fatty- oh wait, no that is Joe Cobb only they didn't know his real name, then Farina, and last Phil MacMahon- WHO you may be asking? Phil MacMahon, the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number in Our Gang Follies of 1938. Still don't know him? Maybe that is because he wasn't a regular cast member and should never have been featured like he was in this collection.Disk One features the shorts Dogs of War and Derby Day. Dogs of War is a silent film featuring the gang running loose on the Hal Roach lot; it is one of my favorite shorts from the series. However, it seems that they ripped off the Cabin Fever print and added a worse score. Derby Day also seems to be lifted from the Cabin Fever series. It is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races. The films themselves are very good.Disk Two features a rarer silent film called Stage Fright. It is a film about a show put on about Marc Anthony by the kids in front of their parents. It is a total disaster. Just like in Reunion in Rhythm, one kid wants to go out on stage and recite poetry. The film has been seriously cut; there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than the usual film length. The print is washed out and new title cards have been inserted. The music is much more childish than normal silent Rascals scores, but it works. There are sound effects too. Sundown Limited is a great short about the gang building their own train. It is a very cute film; Farina is especially funny in it. The train that the kids build would have been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood. The print is washed out and the music sounds just like Grapevine Video's soundtracks. The film titled The Pirates in this set is really called The Buccaneers. It is also a cute film about the kids trying to build their own ship. When it sinks, they find a real one to destroy. This short has also been cut; there is no opener for it either. It is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to it.Disk Three opens with Mary Queen of Tots. It is a really enjoyable film where Mary receives toys that look like the gang. She dreams they come to life, and when she wakes up, she finds the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life. This print is really bad especially considering there is a better print available on another cheaply made DVD set. It is funny that the music is the same on this set as on that one though. The Fourth Alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters. The print on this one is not bad at all. The last film is School's Out, a talkie featuring a different cast. It is a film featuring Miss Crabtree, the new teacher. The picture is good; it seems to be the one from Cabin Fever.Disk Four begins with Bear Shooters. This is a less than great film. The print is great; it is the one from Cabin Fever. Our Gang Follies of 1938 is a great film, very funny, long, and exciting. It features the later talkie cast. Waldo's Last Stand is a film from the later MGM years, a lesser film that seems forced. It was also released in a 5 part Rascals set.Disk Five is the extra features DVD. It starts out with a segment from the You Asked For It television show. On it, some of the silent gang are reunited. Joe Cobb, Jackie Condon, Farina Hoskins, Johnny Downs, and Mickey Daniels are featured. The documentary called Kid Stuff really doesn't have a whole lot of information about the gang although Jackie Cooper is mentioned and Butch Bond does an interview. Other child stars like Jackie Coogan, Judy Garland, Shirley Temple, Roddy McDowall, and Ron Howard are focused on as well.The films in this collection are films that have lapsed into the public domain. Many of them have been available cheaply for years. The only reason a fan might want to see this collection, the same reason I bothered, was to see the rarer silent films. However, the rest of the set is trash	0
"I bought this for my 3yr old twins, and from the first showing, I kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons. My girls already are familiar with some fairy tales, so they really loved ""The Three Little Pigs"" and ""The Pied Piper"". I highly recommend this DVD and think it is a great buy for parents with young children"	1
"I love me some Mamet.  His dialogue takes some getting used to, since it is crafted so as to touch on the edges of realism while inhabiting a more stylistic realm.  I also love his dedication to his actors, employing the same ones over and over, so that his movies come off as different shows performed by the same theatrical troupe, which may very well be his point.However, Edmond is the first Mamet film to leave me disappointed and, worse, annoyed.Macy plays Edmond with typical wide-eyed aplomb.  Edmond is a man who is weak, but is valiantly (if not clumsily) trying to be strong.  The movie starts with a chance encounter with a fortune teller whose tarot card reading provides a cinematic outline for the remainder of the film.  Edmond then goes home, breaks up with his wife, and goes on a deaf, dumb, and blind search for himself, finding instead over-priced whores, pimps who are not-what-they-seem, and -- generally -- everything but himself.I get the point: Edmond is the epitome of modern man's emasculation, unable to find his own balls with both hands, and his tawdry and panicked search through New York for some unnameable salvation is an example of the lengths anyone must go (man or woman) to find, if not redemption, then the places where one ""belongs.""There are a lot of problems here.  Most superficially, there's one of packaging.  The DVD box prominently features a picture of a gun, and no gun appears in the film.  The tags on the box call the film, alternately, a mystery and a fast-paced thriller, when it is neither one of those things.  Not even close.  This movie is (like most of Mamet's work) based on a play; never before has it been more obvious (unless you count the absolutely brilliant Oleanna).  Edmond is, essentially, a one-man show, with Macy delivering numbing and rambling monologues, stopped only occasionally to engage in awkward and almost meaningless side action with ancillary characters (some of them played well -- Denise Richards actually shines in her brief scene as a hooker -- and some of them not so well -- Julia Stiles seems over-medicated in her role as an ambivalent and easily persuaded waitress).  In spite of how they do and don't help Edmond make his way through the tunnel of decadence and misery he creates for himself, most of these characters seem disposable, making the movie come across as equally dismissable.  (I would also like to take a moment here to make a small observation about Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, an actress who appears, I think, in every single one of her husband's films: this woman is, viewed in even the nicest of lights, one of the worst actresses I've ever seen, and she sucks the life out of every scene she's in.  In this movie she plays Edmond's wife, and does so with heartless and uninspired vehemence.  It's nice that Mamet gives his wife the opportunities he does, but one has to wonder if she'd ever get any acting work at all if she weren't married to such a famous writer/director).At the risk of spoiling the film, I will say that, at the end, Edmond finally does find where he ""belongs,"" a place that, given his previous struggles, makes a lot of sense (although the manner in which he finds this belonging might offend more than a few viewers).  But this is small consolation since, by this time, few people are likely to have any sympathy for Edmond or where he ends up.  His character's slap-dash personality combined with the persistent and mostly meaningless monologues on fate, fear, destiny and (ironically) meaning make for a benumbing and distasteful cinematic experience.  A few good performances and some nice, visceral cinematography do not save this film from its plot and the dialogue that fails to move that plot along.  Avoid this flick; try Oleanna or Glen Gary Glenross instead."	0
WOW! This was a pretty decent romantic comedy. We had this in our collection for months (Possibly years) and never watched it. We decided to watch this film on a whim. I have to say that it was better and ever funnier than I thought it would be.Monica Potter is great in her role. It's a sweet movie that actually doesn't do to much guy bashing (the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies). I am also a big fam of Henry Thomas, and he is great at as well.I won't go into the plot here, as many others already have. But what I am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres (Sweet Home Alabama & 13 Going on 30) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention. The other thing that must be said is, with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 (and over 18), why isn't Monica Potter more famous than she is. She can easily be the next Julia Roberts, or Meg Ryan. Julia has 2 kids and Meg has just hit the wall, it's time for a beauty like Monica Potter to get into the very lucrative Romantic Comedy genre. Here's hoping she gets a better agent before it's to late.Cute movie, with a good heart. Definetly made a date night at home wonderful.-Mark(for the record 32yrs old, straight and yes I enjoyed this movie)	1
 Pushing the envelope for explicit, over the counter home videos, 9 SONGS (Tartan) is about one year of sex and rock'n roll in the life of two lovers.  Matt is a young glaciologist.  He meets Lisa at a London rock concert.  That night they start an affair.  In between attending more concerts, they make passionate love.  It's for real and explicit.  Nine live-concert song footage is intercut with their coke-snorting, sexual encounters creating a sometimes ironic reflection of their intense physical but otherwise rather bland relationship.  And finally, all this takes place in the memory of Matt as he flies across the vast frozen wastelands of the South Pole.  This unscripted film is part musical, part drama, part documentary and part performance.  It raises questions about the difference between pornography and art. Controversial and much buzzed about, this not fully satisfying experiment is of interest mainly as a novelty item by a usually innovative and creative director for what it could have been.  And of course the sex.  A special feature eliminates everything but the concert performances.	0
"This is a terrific tour of Hawaii.  The photography is incredible and it shows Hawaii's breathtaking scenery including beautiful beaches on Oahu and Maui, Mt. Haleakala and Waimea Canyon.  The music's great and the narration includes lots of travel tips as you're completely immersed in a Hawaiian vacation - volcanoes, exciting nightlife, surfing, scuba dives and hulas that ""were so alluring that the missionaries banned them"".  The only person who would not like this DVD simply doesn't want to unwind and relax during this fascinating travel guide.  After you see this you'll want to explore this paradise yourself and this DVD will help you plan your trip or your honeymoon"	1
"While this DVD was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times, the genius of David Bowie shines  through. As adults too young to remember or have seen Ziggy Stardust, it was an amazing look at the time period. The sound quality is suprisingly good, although some camera angles are distracting at times. It was also neat to hear Bowie's pronouncement of ""This is our last tour ever."" Little did he know... This DVD is worth every penny. Rock on"	1
My 14 month old son loves the Baby Einstein series.  They've been the only movies to hold his attention.  The sounds and music get his attention, the shapes and colors hold it.That said, this movie never got or held his attention.  There are no interesting sounds or music.  The voices are very monotone.  While I understand the intention of this video, if you don't catch the attention of the child, what's the worth in it?  The pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said.  I also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages, but foreign cultures.  If I knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited, I could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool.  All around, this move was disappointing	0
Dracula.  How dare you call yourself a horror fan without even seeing it?  You don't have to like it, but damn it, you should at least see it.  You can thank Dracula for all the gothic imagery that's been used time and time again in movies throughout the years, right up to this very day.  You can also thank Dracula for all the goth chicks running around, and that's either a good or bad thing depending on your tastes.  Dracula's not my favorite movie from Universal's golden era, but I've seen it quite a few times in my life and will probably see it many more before I buy the farm.  Lugosi managed to create THE Dracula.  They even discuss this in the documentary on the disc, but even folks who have never seen the film before instantly get the image of Lugosi's Dracula in mind when someone brings the subject of Dracula up.  Even with all the different actors who've played the role over the years(some turning in wonderful performances, some not so wonderful), they all seem to be in Lugosi's shadow somehow coz he just WAS Dracula.  Lugosi gave a voice to Dracula.  Ever do a Dracula impersonation or hear someone else do one?  What voice did you(or they) use? Lugosi's of course.  However, I don't think I'd like this film half as much if it hadn't had been for Dwight Frye as Renfield.  Frye is rather unappreciated and never became well known outside the horror circle.  He is to the character of Renfield what Lugosi is to Dracula.  Sorry, Tom Waits just didn't cut the mustard for me.  This film is many years old and probably wouldn't be considered frightening by a five year old kid.  In fact, it most likely comes across as silly to younger folks with Lugosi's exaggerated stares, hand movements and dialogue.  Not to mention Frye's overacting as well.  But the fact of the matter is, this movie scared the pants off people in it's time.  When was the last time modern audiences saw a film that truely frightened them?  Who knows, and it's not likely to happen again in our rather desensitized society.  In fact, I doubt most modern moviegoers even have the attention span to sit through this 75 minute film.  Anyhow, you owe it to Bela, Dwight and yourself to check it out.  As for the other films in the set, it's kinda hit and miss, but none of them are bad by any means.  Apparently somewhere along the lines, Dracula fathered two kids(!) coz we have Dracula's Daughter and Son Of Dracula.  Neither movie is all that bad.  Dracula's Daughter actually tries to be a direct sequel to the original film with the daughter trying to rid herself of the vampire curse.  Dracula's son on the other hand seems to enjoy the vampire lifestyle.  Chaney makes a decent enough vampire, but this son didn't inherit his father's suaveness and charisma.  The spanish version is a really cool gem that almost seems more atmospheric than the american version.  House Of Dracula's kind of the odd one out as it's really a sequel to House Of Frankenstein, which itself is a sequel to Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man.  House of Dracula is best viewed as a double feature with House Of Frankenstein.  Like the Frankenstein and Wolf Man sets, this one has an interesting documentary tracing Dracula from Bram Stoker's novel right up to the Frank Langella film version.  Also sliming his way into this set is Stephen Sommers flapping his gums again about how Dracula influenced his piece of crap Van Helsing movie.  Don't ask me why I watched this feature, maybe I was looking for a reason to get pissed.  Anyhow, with a price tag like this and five Universal classics, it certainly sold me.   	1
This is a great film with a bad guy that you root for from start to finish.  Action packed, and very smart.  Great cast too	1
"I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope.This was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over: Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something = All is well.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Boring, VERY boring. I never once flet any real tension except for the initial ""problem"" which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in the end.  The problem is that all of the ""issues"" the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly.  Rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be OK.  I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?  Nothing really happened.  It was not emotional at all since the ""struggles"" of the men were so poorly portrayed.  To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks!The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again, this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be meaningful.I will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects.Too bad, I had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored.NOT recommended"	0
"In terms of both format and style, ""Rent"" - despite its superficially modernist tendencies - has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition.  Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters.  In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings.  This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like ""Phantom of the Opera,"" which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like ""Rent,"" which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience.  I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers ""Rent"" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, ""Rent"" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.The story, a modern day update of ""La Boheme"" set in Greenwich Village, starts on Christmas Eve, 1989, and ends on Christmas Eve, 1990.  This was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and, indeed, many of the film's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease (AIDS being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story).  There's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists (one is tempted to call them ""deadbeats"") from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block.""Rent"" - with its noble ""performance artists"" doing battle against the Big Bad Corporate Bullies - feels less like a relic from the `80's than one from the `60's.  Though intended to be the heroes of the piece, the artists and bohemians often come across as na�ve, painfully self-absorbed, and annoyingly self-righteous, an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local ATM machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend's name (the heavily allegorical ""Angel"") as the password (this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man).  Anything`s better than actually working, I suppose, and becoming a tool of corporate America.  When one of the men finally takes a dreaded ""job"" ( a mere sinecure, I might add) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes (horrors!), he acts as if he is selling his soul to Satan, and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-God paycheck.  I wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them. With the exception of newcomer Rosario Dawson, the filmmakers have retained most of the original Broadway cast members for the movie, and even though their acting isn't all that impressive, some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing.   In his direction, Chris Columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production, but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we're watching.  Despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ, the film still feels stagy, over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene.  As to the libretto by the late Jonathon Larsen, only one tune strikes me as truly memorable, while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling.  One of the problems, too, with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of ""the opposite of war isn't peace; it's creation"" - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music.  It's not for nothing that the Sharks and the Jets didn't actually sing out most of their confrontations.  There are, admittedly, some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters, but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings I have ever seen in a motion picture.  In that one crucial moment, the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce, taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it. I don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for ""Rent"" (or of its many devoted followers), but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially ""sensitive"" artists - should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for free"	0
Corny science fiction less favorite of mine not even in the top 10 ! Afi took the idea on a better approache of this movie about a boy robot !	0
I watched ten minutes of Beanie Seagal trying to act and turned my DVD player off to read a book.  I had to.  I felt like I was getting dumber by the minute for watching that short segment of the movie. It looked so common I didn't even need to see the rest to tell you the end. I'm willing to bet some people got shot, somebody got away with the crime, the police arrested Beanie, and somebody's mother was yelling at somebody. I don't even care if I'm right or wrong because regardless, I'm not gonna finish watching this movie	0
CSI:Miami, having evolved with some pains over the first three seasons, dips in quality in Season 4 after a very solid 3rd Season. Anyone who has watched the show realizes that Horatio, unlike Gil Grissom or Mac Taylor, is the true star of the show. The rest of the CSIs are entertaining, but the show is truly about him. This dynamic, when combined with the glamour and glitz of the Miami setting and crimes most foul, make this an entertaining CSI and reportedly the most watched show in the world.Plotwise, season 4 gets too involved in personal character arcs to the detriment of the enjoyable crimes and mysteries. Horatio has a bizarre relationship and marriage with Delco's sister, a mole infiltrates CSI Miami, and the Mala Noche gang picks a fight that carries over into the fifth season and causes a death to someone close to Caine. These arcs were handled poorly, especially the storyline of the Mole, which when revealed was utterly anti-climactic, especially considering the Mole will be a series regular in Season 5.Emily Proctor and Rex Linn continue to shine as Calleigh and Detective Frank Tripp. Adam Rodriguez has a sleepwalking performance as Delco, and Johnathan Togo as Ryan Wolfe does little to distinguish himself from Gregg Sanders on the Vegas cast. David Caruso contines his acting by mannerisms technique, perfecting the hands on hip move, the put on sunglasses technique, and the dramatic pauses every four syllables style that has made him the great scene chewing overactor of the year. Watching Caruso is a drinking game's worth of entertainment.The extras of Season 4 are a bit pedestrian, with some audio commentaries, and three featurettes covering show production from shooting to post-production. If you are a fan of the show you will pre-order this one, those who don't like this CSI will be happy to know that Vegas and NYC come out within 30 days of this release. A.G. Corwin St.Louis, MO	1
I absolutely love this movie!  It's one of my favorites and I could watch it over and over.  It's got good plot, good acting and great child stars. I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE to hasn't seen it yet (if there is any such person)	1
"Went to see this movie at the IMAX in San Antonio this weekend.  I have to say I actually laughed most of the way through.  The effects were decent, but most of the time I had trouble making anything out due to the fuzzy 3D effects.  That was when I wasn't having to ""look around"" the bird statues and gargoyles that popped up in the foreground of the shot in blazing white about six inches from my face making it completely impossible to focus on the actual movie.Some of the torture scenes and the Faustian plotline, along with the hideous firey face that is Mr. D make this movie too dark and scary for anyone under the age of 10, but the terrible plot along with the worst voice-acting I have had the displeasure to hear in my life make the film unbearable for anyone over the age of 10.Basically, I guess you could say I was slightly displeased with the movie.  I do have to admit that I got a hearty laugh when the main character, Johnny (played by Jasper Steverlinck, an up-and-coming rocker and lead singer of the band Arid, a decent rock group that was featured at the end of the movie in the only bright spot I could find in the movie) throws his guitar into the fire and begins singing opera to defeat the evil Mr. D and destroy the haunted castle.  Unfortunately, the scene was designed to be serious"	0
"""Domestic Disturbance"" is a thriller about a divorced couple and their child.  Frank (John Travolta) has to deal with a man marrying his ex-wife Susan.  The guy (Vince Vaughn) is well liked by the community, but there are hints of something being amiss with him.  Frank's son claims he witnesses his mother's new husband Rick commit murder.  The more Frank investigates Rick, the more suspicious he looks.  The investigation spurs a game of cat and mouse.There is great interaction between Travolta as a concerned parent and Vaughn the cold heartless type.  The tension between them breeds suspense.  The would-be new father uses his craftiness to manipulate those around him.  There are few things he wouldn't do to get his way.  ""Domestic Disturbance"" is entertaining with its high-tension suspense and great action.  I highly recommend it for those who enjoy a thriller that will keep you guessing to the last minutes."	1
"This film seems to be known worldwide as a ""chick flick"", from the romantic aspects of it, to the current anniversary DVD's pink cover.I'm an 18 year old guy who absolutely digs this film, especially due to the Holly Golightly character. After viewing this film for the first time, I developed a crush on the character Holly (kind of goofy, I guess, but it's very hard for me to dislike a character like her.) Audrey Hepburn played her to perfection. The film was also brilliantly shot by Franz Planer and directed by Blake Edwards. I love the film's dialogue as well, it has a very realistic quality, and it's so fun to hear the characters converse with each other.""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" is perhaps the best ""date"" movie ever conceived.  This film is an absolute classic that is worth subsequent viewings and it will never age."	1

One of the most boring....dull....stupid Peter Sellers comedies.  If you can find more then  2 or 3 laughs good luck.  I love Peter Sellers in THE PINK PANTHER movies and he was brilliant in a great number of films.....but he falls far short in this one and Goldie Hawn is wasted totally	0
"With the New Year just more than six hours away, Imust tell you that no matter a full moon, half moon,quarter moon, or no moon at all, please avoid theflick ""Darkwolf"" for many moons to come.  What a joke. What a silly, stupid, insult to one's intelligence. The script could have been written by my dogStan...and even then, I give him the benefit of thedoubt to come up with something much more canine.  Let's put it this way.  Have you ever seen a film thatcontained people that irritated you so much, yousimply didn't give a ^&^%* if they got blown away?  Iwas hoping the entire cast got mulched by Mr. Wolfless that 30 minutes into this loser.  Go ""Darkwolf"". Take a few chucks out of this cast, its director,producer, writer and editors as quickly aspossible...and don't wait until the next full moon.   ""Darkwolf"" is an insult to motion pictures.  More so,it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as""The Wolf Man"", ""Wolfen"" and ""The Howling"", not tomention the tongue-in-cheek horror classic ""AnAmerican Werewolf in London"".  Need I say more?  ""Darkwolf"" has no bite.  It's clawsand fangs have been chiselled to oblivion.  The boxclaims this flick to be ""Half Man.  Half Wolf. PureEvil.""  In reality it is Half/Whole Stupid. Half/WholeWorthless.  ...and...Pure ^%&*!  Get my drift?  At midnight...as we turn another pageand the new year unfolds...I promise you you willenjoy reruns of every episode of ""Mary Hartman, MaryHartman"", much more than ""Darkwolf"".  I'm off to watch yet another New Year's flick beforedawn.  I need to make amends to Lon Chaney, Jr. beforemidnight.

"AFI finally release a live DVD, and as a portrayal of the band as it stands now, it is very impressive. It does lack older, more hardcore punk tracks, but that is to be expected as the band grows and matures into the  band it is now. Each album progresses towards more epic scales, and songs balance beauty with power. ""I Heard a Voice"" captures this on film, and the fan gets to witness AFI at their most grandiose. Watching vocalist Davey Havok sing ""God Called in Sick Today"" while being held up by the audience is amazing to watch and gives this reviewer chills everytime. The masterful command of theatrics from each member, especially Havok, creates a powerful feeling unable to fully describe but easy to appreciate. The setlist itself is perfectly put together, with the only gripe being the exclusion of ""Kiss and Control."" The rest of the songs display all facets of AFI, from the fast paced ""Dancing Through Sunday"",(which includes a nicely executed guitar solo by guitarist Jade Puget) ""Kill Caustic"", ""Death of Seasons"", ""Totalimmortal"" and ""A Single Second"", (the last of which features a guest appearance by Nick 13 of Tiger Army) to the slower paced ""This Time Imperfect"" and ""Endlessly, She Said"" as well as all of their recent singles, and a few more cuts from their latest releases ""Decemberunderground"" and ""Sing the Sorrow"". Extras are geared towards the fans, with Despair Faction interviews and the inclusion of videos from their massive scavenger hunt prior to the Decemberunderground release, as well as a poster. Each band member has their moments to shine, and are all very capable and talented muscians. Bassist Hunter Burgan and drummer Adam Carson lay down a solid foundation as well as background vocals, as Puget layers his unique guitar sound and obvious mastery, in this genre, over the instrument. This is all built up to allow Havok to use his unique vocal approach to wander in between melodies and notes, mixing powerful singing with a fantastic screaming voice, to create beautiful atmospheres of sound that can crash down on you just as easily as it hypnotizes you.The quality of the sound production as well as the video edits are fantastic. Unlike other live DVD's, where the concert is edited to the point of a music video, ""I Heard a Voice"" has just the right amount to not make you forget you are watching a live dvd, but also add to the overall effect of the performance. The sound is very clear, and the sound levels are perfectly set to allow each member to cut through the mix. This is overall a very stellar production, and fans who have already embraced the new direction of the band, as well as new fans and casual fans, should find the dvd to be quite entertaining and a very worthwhile buy"	1
This would be a steal at twice the price.  I don't know what possessed Spike Lee to offer five of his best movies at such a low price.  Do the Right Thing is a brilliant movie, capturing both the rhythms and tensions of Lee's beloved Brooklyn, which he would return to time and again.  Lee is at his best when avoiding the polemics and sticking to character-driven movies.  Jungle Fever and Mo' Better Blues stand out in this regard, because they are first and foremost about people.  Jungle Fever introduced the great Samuel L. Jackson, as well as launched Wesley Snipes in an intense social drama which revolves around an inter-racial love affair.  Jackson stole most of the scenes however as the drug-addled brother who simply couldn't get his act straight no matter how hard he tried.  Mo' Better Blues exposed Lee's love for jazz.  Moody and atmospheric, with Denzel Washington delivering a solid performance, the film tries to recapture the spirit of the Harlem Renaissance.  Clockers was his crime drama with plenty of tension. Crooklyn revolved mostly around amusing family disputes, with Alfre Woodard as a strong mother figure.  It was probably the least satisfying of the five, but fun to watch just the same.  Lee embelishes his movies with such rich cinematic color, and offers numerous fascinating camera angles such as his now famous walking scenes in Jungle Fever.  Not since Gordon Parks, had someone done so much for black cinema, rescuing it from the blaxploitation films of the 70's	1
The depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned. From the moment they reached King Kong's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience. I felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape. How can anyone feel anything for King Kong? He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes. I kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end	0

"I'm a huge Don Cheadle fan, but this film is unworthy of him. [People] who claim that it's a story about racism either don't understand the film or don't understand racism. Basically, here's the plot: The character played by Mekhi Pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store. Rather than summon help for the others, all Pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register. He is caught, and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life. That is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film, because Pfeiffer's family insists on proving that he's no animal and can take his punishment -- in this case, death -- with his head held high. Yeah, right. Guess what? He is an animal, and if the story had involved all-black or all-white characters, racism wouldn't be an issue. A more compelling question: if Pfeiffer's family was so concerned with his ""dignity,"" why didn't they teach him moral values in the first place"	0

I enjoy all three of the the Jurassic Park movies, though I think &quot;The Lost World&quot; is a bit weak.  While I think that anyone who enjoys action movies, monster movies, or horror movies should own all three, I find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies, but a fourth DVD containing substantial background information on the making of the movies.  I give this collection four stars only because the larger, more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two, you will definitely like the third movie	1
Guess I'm in the minority about this, but this PLAY (NOT a MOVIE) left me thinking that I wasted my money.  I enjoyed Madea, she is a great character.  I never seem to care about the rest of the people or their problems. For me the only thing funny about it was when Madea took the stage, the rest of it was simply boring	0
This is a fine collection for those who have recently discovered early REM as well as those who own REM's previous IRS years video collection: Succumbs.

"Let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even ""boring"" to my friends.  So it isn't the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me.  It isn't the unresolved ending that bothered me.  It wasn't the violence (in short bursts.)  It wasn't the acting (the acting was pretty good actually).  But as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure.  I didn't care who was sending the tapes and I didn't care what would happen with the main characters.  They were unrelatable on just about any level.  This movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3/4's of the way in and you'll think, ""wow I wonder where the story will go next"".  And then it doesn't.  That was it.  Very disappointing.  I don't mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there's SOME kinda payoff in the end.  I really don't understand all the acclaim that this movie got.  As a ""suspense"" movie or as an ""art"" film it fails pretty miserably.  The premise was a good idea that went nowhere...slowly.  Viewer beware. "	0
Expect a liberal dose of everything you generally do from a martial arts flick -- slapstick comedy, overly melodramatic subplotting, and, on occasion, even a hint of a story. All that aside (which is how I am sure the director saw it) the balletic, intricate and often incredible stunt work during the action scenes is an absolute treat. Jet Li's utter disregard for human limits is evident as he turns in a surprisingly measured yet kinetic performance, nothing like his forgettable Hollywood yawns.  The subtitles for this Mandarin-language effort are a bit difficult to read, since the English is in small print below the more prominent Chinese subtitles. But when the action kicks into gear, forget them and just watch the graceful choreography of the fight scenes.Notably notable in the three installments: PART-I:  A mind-blowing hook-and-ladder battle, plus a terrific umbrella sequence.PART-II: The climactic fight with Donnie Yen. The speed and technique shown during the double-pole fight is staggering; Yen's moves with his cloth staff left me gob-smacked. PART-III: This one clearly suffers and is even borderline skippable. The final fight scene at the lion-dance competition is a colorful pageant, but lacks the impact of the one-on-one fights in the first two films, mainly because the participants are all wearing giant lion head masks.All in all, can't go Wong with this purchase.	1
"I unfortunately wound up seeing this Christmas Misgiving on its original airing.  I have always been a fan of any Christmas special since Rudolph hit the air way back when. Each holiday season I hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the ""New Rudolph"".  This is so far away from that you would need the Hubble Space scope in order to see how close it came.  The imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise. Regrettably the story makes Santa vs. the Martins look like an Oscar contender.  Such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3D gimmickry.  You can't improve on failure. After it aired on TV I didn't see it return in later years on regular TV. I didn't miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely.  Can't win them all"	0
I'll make this short and sweet - this is by far the BEST Bond movie of them all, IMHO.  Excellent work by Connery and the rest of the cast	1
"The series just keeps on getting better.The Bob Newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television.   The other funny show was ""Newhart"", which I cannot understand why it has not been released on DVD.The whole cast just clicks.  I wish shows like this were still on television.If you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets!"	1
There are enough reviews of the main movie story so I don't need to add anything in that regard.  But, what on earth does a lesbian sub-story (in both regards) have to do with the story as a whole?  Nothing.  So, we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue-grass music and the Appalachian way of life that, instead, heads for the trash bin	0
The special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period--there's a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done. Doris and Perry Como's duet together was ok (but Perry seemed to not like Doris flirting with him.) Doris Day has always been under-rated as a singer. Her voice is sheer perfection. It's too bad that Doris didn't do more specials or have a variety/comedy/musical show like Carol Burnett.	1
This was our first Bob DVD and maybe I just chose wrong. My son waited for the theme song the whole time and it never played. Maybe that is the norm...This whole thing is kinda strange. My son likes it but doesn't love it. I simply should have researched more	0
"I hate lawyers.What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb. Shakespeare said it first and best: ""First, let's kill all the lawyers!"". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: ""get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!"" Exactly. Anyway, ""The Firm"" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it. But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money. Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel ""The Firm"": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention. I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW?What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**. Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in ""The Firm"", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice. Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and ""The Firm"" cried out for cinematic treatment. So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of ""The Firm"" is such a yawner. Talk about contempt of court.Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, ""The Firm"" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob. Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: ""The Firm"" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much. Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice. Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't. Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks.  Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous. If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar. Otherwise, case dismissed. JS"	0
"Is Larry an actual redneck, or is it all really a joke inside ""Larry's"" mind?  I sometimes think that Dan Whitney (Larry's real name) knows what he's doing.  I think he is actually making a huge joke out of the rednecks who are totally in love with him.  He is openly mocking them, and when they might get a tad uncomfortable, but then he'll drop a politically incorrect joke into the routine, and they love him again.  Dan/Larry started out as a ""normal"" comedian (there's footage of him on youtube before his Larry incarnation), and wasn't really getting anywhere with that.  So he became a redneck, and is a multi-millionare now.  But all his redneck fans think of Larry as a ""regular guy"", despite the fact that Larry lives in one of those fancy houses that rednecks think only NYCers live in (for the record, NYCers don't all live in fancy houses.  There's a lot of working class people in NYC who live in regular houses and regular apartments).  So Larry is taking advantage of illiterate, easily amused rednecks.  Just put on a flannel shirt, fart, wear a Confederate flag, and say you hate liberals, then fleece the rednecks!  I don't think Larry really has a redneck mentality (even though he's originally from Nebraska, so he has some hillbilly cred, so to speak).  I think he's just making a ton of money off of easily amused people.     "	0
Jeez, maybe I am getting old, but I really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest.  A brilliant scientist.  Disfigured.  Angry.  Finds temporary techie fix for face.  Goes to get bad guys.  Fighting.  More fighting.  Still more fighting.  Ex mate learns he's alive.  He leaves her anyway (he's too ugly).  The end.  More to come, if successful.  Not recommended	0

"I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's ""performance"" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$"	0
I have watched this film on my local PBS station at least 1/2 dozen times because it is soooooo good. I have a mental vacation each time. I find that my stress just goes away while watching this awe inspiring movie. I HIGHLY recommend this film for the whole family	1
"This film is a landmark in blending science and advocacy. It seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives, not unlike our own.  But it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity. It avoids going too far into the subjective. It doesn't try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute/stagey displays of animal interaction. Instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments. But by the sheer genious of editing and writing, one cannot help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama.  The movie wisely lets the animals' behavior ""do the talking"", and doesn't try to push the viewers' judgement one way or the other. It left me rethinking everything I had assumed about  animals, emotions, and the nature of our (and by 'our' I mean all of God's creatures) existence"	1
I live in Colorado, one of the states that receives emergency funding because the illegal alien situation has gotten so out of hand. This movie is about a town called Farmingville and the disruptions in their lives as they (literally) wake up to find mass groups of illegals outside of their neighborhoods. Some live 20 to a house and have cars coming and going every day-(imagine how that would bring down the resale value on a home?) The aliens surround the streets to hustle for work right out  in the open. The video documents the two sides ( the ones who support, and oppose) the situation. The side that opposes the intrusion into their lives painfully reveals their  exasperation at their own city's inability to instill order and law. As women who go to the neighborhood 7/11 are whistled at, they become nervous ( as a women offered in the video-unfortunetly it was not shown). The thick misogyny in the Mexican aliens was especially disturbing (example: a women who was with a special interest gruop to offer services to the illegal men was unsure whether they would listen to her, as in the Mexican culture). Some create groups in support, others create and claw for order. Eventually a town meeting is called in which one of the women who runs the opposing group is called a rascist by her own politicians as he is flanked by two illegal aliens who nod in agreement.  It is especially poignant to watch as this everday American women  brings the situation to her counsil members. They call her a rascist, and many of the illegal aliens surround this politician in support.It was disturbing to see a foreign lawbreaker have more influence over our politicians than one law-abiding women and her attempts at trying to instill order in her own town.  I don't believe it portrayed the opposing townspeoples side very fairly. They had every right to be exasperated-our we not in a terror war? Since when does Mexicos problems come before our own? Maybe because it was made by Carlos Sandaval it was more unobjective. I felt the film more unfairly depicted the opposing (against illegal immigrants) as 'mean' rather than literally mindblown and aggravated their laws weren't being enforced! When does the nations people not have a voice in their own country?	0

I purchased Dick Cavett's John Lennon and Yoko Ono interview and it was great. It was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material. I gained new insight about John and Yoko. So I bought Cavett's interview of Jimi Hendrix expecting something similar. The 15 minutes of glib questions by Cavett produced nothing new about Hendrix. Included in the DVD are a few minutes of Jimi playing at Woodstock. The rest of the DVD is mediocre at best.	0

I am a faithful CSI watcher, and have been since the shows inception.I buy the DVD sets and enjoy them tremendously.  However, there aretwo trends I see developing that I don't care for---one, there istoo much Catherine.  We know everything about her kid, her deadhusband, her crook father, etc., and she's really an annoying character.  She makes nasty comments about everyone; she's always being insubordinate;she goes out with men half her age (let's quit trying to makeher seem like a young chick when she isn't, especially wearing thoseskin tight jeans), she is very arrogant, and even though she continuallyscrews up (loses her camera; blows up the lab in a previous season,accuses people before she has all the evidence), they made her asupervisor.  Also, the plot line with Grissom and Sara, while predictable, is not the greatest.  I think Grissom would be better off paired with Lady Heather.  There's an idea!  Let's see moreof Lady Heather.  Still, even with the annoying overabundance of the least likable character (Catherine), the show is one of the best, if not THE best, on TV (up there with Without a Trace, NCIS and Numbers).  Keep 'em coming	1
"This was a subject of much conversation when I was deployed to Saudi Arabia and it's still a favorite with most military and Civilians in Iraq. ""Ground Hog Day"" is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same...until finally,the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it's the day you leave. The movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique; Bill Murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well. It's fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man, and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here."	1
This movie is 24 hours of kids being amoral creatures doing whatever strikes their fancy at the moment. Sex, drugs, beating on people, stealing, whatever keeps boredom at bay. There is no script to speak of, just watching them being themselves. One kid called Telly (about 15 or 16) who has AIDS (and may not know it) likes young virgins (12 to 14 year old girls). He's a predator with no conscience at all. Probably a sociopath. And his buddy Casper is a dumb punk who swills beer. He's just as bad as Telly. I have no doubt that teens like this exist. They existed back in the '70s when I was a teen. I'm sure most of the viewers of this disturbing movie don't have children. Perhaps parents need to view this to see what unsupervised teens are doing. I'm sure kids like this are not just only in the slums but in suburbia too. And small towns. And even rural areas. This movie isn't for the squeamish but if one parent watches and starts giving their child more attention it might be worth a sleepless night or a feeling of revulsion for them.	1

"This movie certainly had some strong actors and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed it on my viewing list.Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this film.  I figured there would be a little more real suspense or ""thrill"" but it never materialized and instead just followed many of the usual plot events.  The biggest failure was the completely unneccessary cheesey romance between Eastwood and Russo. It was contrived, lame, and almost laughable. I had to rub my eyes to make sure I wasnt having a nightmare!John Malkovich does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this role.  Unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and even his character did some staple moves.  Clint Eastwood was great as always but he did play his usual self. No problem here though, Clint was solid.The film just fizzled as it went along and it started to get tiresome towards the very end.  The climax was rather anti-climactic except for the shooting scene which was kind of cool although I saw it coming a mile away.  There was not as much suspense as I was hoping for and the ""thrill"" was mostly missing.What else can I say, watch it and make your own decision but overall I was not that impressed and the film let me down a bit after such glowing reviews"	0
"Alyssa Milano's mother (who is also her manager) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet.  She's denounced such websites' ""exploitation"" on national TV, and has even developed a side business as a cybercop, lending her web-busting skills to other stars.  Milano's mother/manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film.Embrace of the Vampire is softcore horror porn, and the source for many of those Milano skin pics.  After TV's Who's the Boss was canceled (but before Charmed returned Milano to star status) Milano was just another unemployed former child actress, so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time. Milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody-two-shoes girl she'd played in Who's the Boss.  In other words, she wanted to ""grow"" as an actress.  So she did Embrace of the Vampire, in which she goes topless in several scenes, engages in a lesbian romp with Charlotte Lewis, and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body.Mission accomplished.Actually, Embrace of the Vampire uses Milano's virginal image from Who's the Boss by casting her as ... a virgin.  A virgin whose boobs are straining against her too-tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend (albeit asking him not to look), but still, a virgin.  A virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and doesn't know why.Here's why: Milano is the reincarnation of Martin Kemp's true love.  Some 300 years ago, a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned Kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy.  Now that he's rediscovered Milano, he has three nights to rekindle her love for him.  If so, they will live forever as vampires.  If not, he dies and loses her forever.Why the sudden three-night deadline?  Why not.The plot and motivations are paper thin, as is typical of porn.  Milano wanders around campus, wondering why she's having so many sexual dreams, even daydreams.  Her boyfriend wanders about, wondering if she's so pure.  Kemp wanders about, seen by Milano but often not by others.  Lewis wanders about for some bisexual action.  Other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action.  Amid all this wandering there's much carnal action, and more carnal dreaming.  Occasionally, Kemp kills someone for dissing Milano.  John Stanley (in his Creature Features movie guide) correctly refers to it as a ""meandering, almost formless script.""Kemp has the best lines.  Like many vampires, he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst over a lost love.  His appearance is a touch effeminate (too much eyeliner), but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character.  He is part romantic vampire, part bloodthirsty beast.  Lewis's small part is pointless to the ""story.""  All that's required is that she undress, and when she does, it was worth the wait.  Rachel True (The Craft) has an even smaller role, the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on.All of the above three are more interesting, more charismatic, than Milano or her boyfriend.  At film's end, Kemp's tearful bloodthirsty angst, and Milano's tearful rediscovery of her love, the ""tragic"" star-crossed ending, and the Christian iconography, all mirror Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).  One senses that director Goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material.However, this is no poor woman's Bram Stoker's Dracula.  Milano is no Winona Ryder and Kemp is no Gary Oldman.  For that matter, none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts.  And the budget just isn't there.  The strength of low-budget horror is a gritty authenticity, which this film tries to hide rather than utilize.How low was the budget?  Listen, I was an extra on both Bram Stoker's Dracula and Embrace of the Vampire.  (In both instances, I kept my clothes on.)I worked one day on Embrace of the Vampire.  Don't look for me, I ended up on the cutting room floor, and extras are rarely mentioned in credits.  But let me tell you an ""inside story"" on the making of this film:We were shooting in a nightclub on the Sunset Strip.  The extras were divided into three camps: union, nonunion, and Modesto extras.  Union extras earn the most, especially once overtime kicks in, so they were wrapped after eight hours (they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota).  This was during my nonunion days (I'm in SAG now), so I put in a full 14 hours, after which we were paid in cash and wrapped.  The Modesto extras were still working when we left.Now what, you may ask, is a Modesto extra?  I also wondered, and so I asked one.  I was told they were from an acting class in Modesto, California.  They had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a ""class assignment.""  In other words, they were PAYING to come to work.There's not a whole lot to learn about being an extra.  It's neither glamourous nor difficult.  And nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are VERY EASY to come by.  The lampposts in Los Angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle, ehr, extras.  I did it for the cash, and because if you do it often enough, you increase your chances of getting into the union (which I did, after some 13 grueling months).NEVER PAY for the ""chance"" to be an extra, not in Los Angeles.  I made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times, but wised up after a few months.  My guess is the producers of Embrace of the Vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle, and far less than even nonunion extras cost.  I know this teacher was getting paid by the students, and that they were not getting paid to be on the film.Another inside story: Someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member.  She was near tears because it had sentimental value.  Never leave anything of value lying around on a set.And some trivia: John Stanley says this film was ""originally conceived as The Nosferatu Diaries,"" but on the set, we were told the working title was The Collector.Embrace of the Vampire is a decent time-killer ... barely.  If you're looking for horror, there are hundreds of better films.  Dozens of better vampire films.  Even many superior erotic vampire films -- Vampyres (British, 1975) comes to mind.But if you're looking for Milano nudies, this is the film to see."	0
"The scene where Eric Idle whines ""Oh, you're no fun anymore!"" is a deceptive one. If anything, these guys are even more fun than before. The second half of Monty Python's Flying Circus's first season is even more polished and mad than the first, continuing the tradition of short skits focused on complete insanity. In these episodes, we have: a serial-killer barber; lecherous art critics; an unfortunate man who tries to eat a cathedral, tunnel to Java and jump the English channel; Ken Shabby, every girl's dad's nightmare; thuggish old ladies; bloodthirsty librarians who want to hire a gorilla; camel-spotting; and prime ministers falling through the earth's crust.The longest and most bizarre skit is one where people mysteriously start turning into Scotsmen and streaming north of the border. Soon ""Scotland will be choked with SCOTSMEN,"" and England is pretty much abandoned. The culprits: tennis-playing, human-devouring blancmanges from the galaxy of Andromeda.And, of course, the stuff that has become comedy legend: the scene where John Cleese tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store (""It's a stiff! Bereft oflife, it rests in peace!""), and the Lumberjack Song (""I cut down trees. I skip and jump/I like to press wild flowers/I put on women's clothing/And hang aroundin bars..."").Of course, no mere description can do justice to the comic brilliance of these  dozens of skits. These five Brits (and one American, who did the little cartoons) created some of the most unabashed, naughty, nasty, and just plain weird comedy ever, which still influences everything from Saturday Night Live to author Jasper Fforde. And all of this by men who often dress up as the world's most unattractive girls, with only a tiny budget and minimal cast. The 70s production values are omnipresent, and they are decidedly unpolitically correct. But in a weird way, these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise -- the writing and acting are pure, raw, unrefined comedy.          Probably the most memorable actors here are Cleese and Idle. Cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone, as well as having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice. And Eric Idle does a good job as everyone from a housewife to a wannabe mountain climber, while Michael Palin does a brilliant job as people who are timid or insane. By this point, the Monty Python guys had polished up their skits and reached a steady plateau of comic brilliance. In other words, it's funny and should be watched"	1
This DVD has a lot of good info and practical tips for improving starts, turns, and finishes for competitive swimmers.

This DVD is a great complement to the DVD's offered by VCE(Trinity and Beyond, Nukes in Space, etc). By itself, it is a highly technical look at the process of testing materials, military equipment, and building materials during three atomic test series covered on the DVD set. The quality of the film varies between the three discs. The last Civil Defense video on Disc 2 suffers a lot of audio warble, unfortunately. But, it is nice to see these important historical documents preserved in a digital format.I've owned Trinity and Beyond for several years, and I really enjoy the way it is presented. But, it has to cover so many tests in a short amount of time that it skims over a lot of information about testing procedures, etc. You begin to get the impression that the military was doing these tests for their own amusement. After watching this DVD, I have a much better understanding of the entire process. It's easy to see why the military was eager to do so many tests in the early days of the atomic weapons program. The science of the atomic bomb was a moving target, and this DVD outlines the research they made. Though I would never like to see anyone use atomic weapons ever again, their sheer power is fascinating, beautiful, and frightening at the same time. If you are interested in the science of atomic testing, you should really take a look at this set	1

"Haven't we all been there? Wishing we could be better than someone else? Wishing that we had our turn in the spotlight? This is exactly how the movie ""Cheaters"" affected me. I found it truly amazing that this movie was made on a true story like this. The plot is really incredible and actually makes you ponder the question ""What would I do in this situation?"" Jeff Daniels and Jena Malone give such incredible performances in this movie. I believe that they are very convincing. If you are in the mood to be emotionally touched by a movie, ""Cheaters"" is the true direction for you to head in"	1

The first X-Men movie was fantastic. The second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better. This third movie was absolute trash and I will never buy it	0
...but the movie was pretty good. I found myself highly disappointed in the book, and almost wasn't able to finish it. The characters were flat, the story reading like a history lesson in religion through the ages, and not a true story, so I wasn't sure what to make of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised though, to enjoy the movie immensely. It was long, but it kept the pace going throughout. The subtitling in the Latin and French was a bit mundane to drudge through, but it made the movie a bit more 'believable' than everyone speaking English when the main character is actually French.Teabing was played brilliantly, and while Hanks was not who I would have thought for Langdon, he did a superb job in the role.If you can set your personal beliefs aside and view the movie as a piece of exceptional fiction drama and suspense, it is well worth watching. Murder, mystery, suspense, action, drama... it's all there in this film	1
We have all of the series that have been released so far and enjoy them all.  This was one great show!	1
"I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops. First example, they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door yelling ""Police, you're under arrest.""They kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort. Cut to Pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit, too? Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough. By the way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half hour too"	0

I thought this movie was great!  It's definitely for the more cultured and intillectual movie-goer.  It's probably the best dark comedy I've ever seen (only to rival the masterpiece that is &quot;Heathers&quot;).  The dialog in this movie with leave you with one-liners for years to come.  After seeing &quot;Party Girl&quot; I fell in love with Parker Posey, and when I saw this I loved her even more. This instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time, but then again I'm a huge fan of good dark comedies and I have a sick sense of humor. Everyone I know absolutely loved this move (including my MOM!) In any event, this is a definite must-see for any fan of Parker Posey and dark comedy.  Excellent	1
I think I just don't like pilates because I really didn't care for this workout. Plus, you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you'll have a round hard belly. This is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes. So, that's the main reason I just didn't like this video	0
"This film is visually stunning and impressive, and has talented and credible actors.  Unfortunately, there is barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are ""trained""/brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity.  The settings and group ""sermons"" from Nazi officials are striking and convincing, but there is nothing that ties it all together.  Our hero fails to strike the ""killer blow"" and is stripped, literally and figuratively, of all status and walks away.  The end.I'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film, and I was surprised by how un-gay it was.  In fact, the two boy ""friends"" work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress.  It's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else. I have issues with some of the pacing as well.  I found myself pressing the fast forward button several times, and didn't really seem to miss much.  Not a good sign.So, for what it is, it's okay.  Certainly not a masterpiece, and certainly not something to run out and buy. "	0
Steven Spielberg's classic masterpiece JAWS did not have a stellar plot.  It was a bubblegum storyline: a monstrous shark terrorizes a beach town on the east coast.  In the hands of any other director, it would have been a terrible film, something to laugh at on lonely Saturday nights while chowing down popcorn.  In the hands of Mr. Spielberg, however, it became one of the very finest and most memorable films ever made.  Steven Spielberg's hands were nowhere near JAWS: THE REVENGE.Okay, so here's the plot.  Remember JAWS 3-D?  Well, that never happened.  Chief Brody - from the first movie - is dead.  His wife, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), is living a happy life in Amity until her youngest son is killed - by a great white shark.  Ellen flies down to the Bahamas with her other son, Michael Brody (Lance Guest).  Though her family and friends assure her that she is crazy, Ellen believes that the shark from the first movie - yes, the one that Chief Brody killed - is back for revenge, hunting down her family and killing them one-by-one.  Even though it died.  In the first movie.  Confused?  Any sensible moviegoer would be.  It's best to completely shut down your brain while watching the third JAWS sequel.  As you now know, the story is completely absurd.  The script, by Michael De Guzman, is unintentionally hilarious, filled with outrageously funny dialogue.  For example, in one scene, pilot Hoagie (played by Michael Caine!) is courting Ellen Brody.HOAGIE: I have an irresistible urge to kiss you, Ellen Brody.ELLEN: Why?HOAGIE: Because ... it would not occur to you why.And if that's not confusing enough for you, feast upon this nugget of dialogue, from a conversation between Michael and Ellen Brody.ELLEN: Why did you come out here?  Why did you come out here?MICHAEL: Mom!  Mom!  WHY did you take the boat?ELLEN: It [the shark] kept coming!MICHAEL: Don't you realize what you're doing?ELLEN: I've tried to tell you, there was nothing else to do!MICHAEL: Mom, you shouldn't have done it.ELLEN: I've tried to tell you, I've tried!Joseph Sargent's directing is terrible; it's clear that the actors have no clue what they are doing.  Which may be why the acting is so horrible.  The highlight of the cast is Lance Guest, whose straight-faced performance overshadows the very talented Michael Caine's by a longshot.  The horrid acting is forgivable, however; after all, how could someone even attempt to keep a straight-face in a film so absurd?  A film in which sharks roar, swim from New England to the Bahamas to kill family members, and leap thirty feet out of the water?On the plus side, JAWS: THE REVENGE is enormously fun to watch, thanks to its ridiculousness and unpurposeful hilarity.  It is very likely one of the worst films ever made - JAWS 3-D looks like the original when compared to this film - but if there's nothing else on TV some late night, grab some popcorn and a frosty beverage and enjoy the absurdity that is JAWS: THE REVENGE	0
"Fellini brings light on space instead of space on light. He brings mysticism to the movie not the movie to mysticism.He brings boredom and rattling to a new height. Lots of nice emotionalism and sweat. Waging tongues and blood. Candles and tits. Bondage and perversion. We learn Italian words that we can not use.Here is a good tidbit ""Child of Aphrodite and Hermes...Hermaphrodite.""The subtitles conveniently disappear at crucial moments. Even in Italian the voices do not match the sound. One of the roman dudes Encolpio (Martin Potter) finally got a real part as ""Doctor Who"" in1983."	0
If this movie was ever going to have a chance, it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long, or never attempted in the first place. Some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay - Possession just can't be dealt with that way. What you have as a result is another story entirely. There just wasn't time enough, I guess, to develop the characters, or even to include half of them. The only character true to the book and left almost intact was Sir George. The rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating, and we are left with painful stereotypes and, in the case of Roland Michell, a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming. My best advice is that if you've read the book, skip the movie, but if you saw the movie, you should do yourself a favor and get the book	0

"I will be utterly honest, I don't buy music CDs anymore.  With so many bands hitting the streets faster than I can imagine, I honestly cannot keep up with them all.  Music begins to sound the same, corporations seem to have their pre-determined hit prior to the public even forming their own opinion.  Those like the Simpsons, Backstreet Boys, and even hip-hop artists are blending together to sound uniform, unoriginal, and overly drab.  I had nearly lost my faith in music, retreating to some of my older music like DMB, Counting Crows, and Travis, but then I found ... The Suns.Stumbling around the Internet I discovered, shockingly, one of the videos to their album called ""Romantic Death"".  It was one of the most creative and disturbing videos that I have seen in quite some time.  Then it hit me, I couldn't get this song out of my mind.  Throughout the whole day I had the beat, the lyrics, and the overall sensation of the song stuck in my mind ... and I had only heard it once.  Like a drug, I needed more.  When I returned home that evening I found the song again and couldn't stop listening to it.  For the first time in a long time, I had found a new band.Then, I bought this album.  Knowing nothing about the band except for the ""Romantic Death"" song, I put this in my DVD player and continued to be impressed.  Their videos are just as smart as their music.  Their tracks seem to cover every genre of music from folk, rock, and even hard edge.  Their lyrics seem well-considered, smart and a voice to a new generation.  My favorites of the album are:  ""Must Be You""""Romantic Death"" (Parental Guidance is suggested) ""Lost at Home""""Rockstop""""We Tried""In fact, every time I listen to this album I find a new song to explore, a new song to jam to on the way to work; a new song to enjoy!  For those skeptical of this band, I suggest this album to test your tastes.  Not only does it provide songs for you to burn onto other CDs which allow friends and family to explore this band, but also all of their energetic, original videos that will never see the light of day on MTV, but can be watched from the leisure of your DVD player.  The Sun are a breath of fresh air to the music industry and this album finally got me out of the corporate rut that seems to be plaguing this industry.""...if the rockstops, it'll be all my fault...""Grade: ***** out of ***** "	1

This product was a bad choice for me. It was a poorly done product. It was washed out, the quality, both audio and video was terrible. It was not enjoyable to watch. The packaging was cheap quality. I should have known better. Pay more and get a nice set, and a better product. Don't try and save a few dollars if you want something to enjoy. Paper sleeves make for a cheap copy.	0
This is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations. This film's strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them. Sean Connery plays Captain Marko Ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film. Tim Curry is amusing as the dutiful Dr. Petrov in a role well suited for him. The rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of Sean Connery and Tim Curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film. Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer, Sam Neill as Captain Vasily Borodin, Scott Glenn as Commander Bart Mancuso, Richard Jordan as Dr. Jeffrey Pelt and an impressive Peter Firth as Political Officer Ivan Putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story. This was probably one of Alec Baldwin's best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of Jack Ryan should have been portrayed. Baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of Jack Ryan embodied. Sam Neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country's political dictates and ambitions. Sam Neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly. I liked Scott Glenn's character immensely as the US Commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him. The list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film. Their efforts make this film a great political, action-adventure and emotional drama. 	1

"Wow, I just viewed ""Spun"" the other night and I thought this movie was outrageous. This is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards. ""Spun"" has an impressive cast of recognized actors. The film is, essentially, about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts. There is The Cook (Mickey Rourke, he truly makes this story worth watching), who makes the drug (speed) and sells it to Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), a dealer with a junkie girlfriend, Cookie (Mena Suvari, looking infinitely less attractive than she did in ""American Beauty""). One of his clients is Ross (Jason Schwartzman), who does a lot of favours for The Cook and his girlfriend, Nikki (Brittany Murphy).  I was surprised at how funny the film was at times. It doesn't drown us in anti-drug messages, nor does it become one of those, equally tedious, drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party. The humour is dark, certainly, but funny nevertheless. A lot of it comes from a subplot about Frisbee, Patrick Fugit,  who is caught by a couple of TV policemen (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get Spider-Mike. I will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead.This is a film with a lot of energy, that seems, like its characters, not entirely sure where it is going, but determined to get there, and quickly. Although I am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober, this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too. The director, Jonas �kerlund, has directed music videos in the past, and it shows in his impatient filming style, as he plays around with animation, speeded-up camerawork and such like.I'm not recommending the film for its style though, although I am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen. I am recommending it because I liked the main characters, which I think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens. I can imagine an entire film about The Cook and Nikki, or Spider Mike and Cookie, or even just Ross, who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days. What makes ""Spun"" better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community, and we feel as if we are watching their everyday, speeded up, sleepless lives. Simply amazing."	1
"This is an awesome movie! I think its better than Anchors Aweigh. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are two baseball players named Eddie O'Brien and Dennis Ryan who play for the Wolves. During the off-season Eddie and Dennis are vaudeville stars. When they return for the baseball season the whole team is horrifed to hear that the new owner K.C. Higgins wants to take an active part in coaching. As it turns out the K in K.C. Higgins happens to stand for Katherine (Esther Williams) so the new owner is a woman. Katherine dosn't fall for womanizer Eddie so the two don't get along at all!! Dennis does fall for her though, but Katherine isn't in love with him. Shirley Delwyn (Betty Garrett) has her eyes on Dennis and she won't give up on him! Also in the cast is Jules Munshin who plays Nat Goldberg, Dennis and Eddie's baseball pal. This movie has a lot of great music.The songs include ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" Frank and Gene sing this song as their vaudeville act. Also Williams sings this while swimming in the pool. ""Yes, Indeedy"" The boys sing this song to the baseball team when they return from their vaudeville act. Its about their love life.""O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg"" Kelly, Sinatra, and Munshin sing this song! One of the best numbers!""The Right Girl for Me"" Sinatra sings this song to Williams.""It's Fate, Baby""  Garrett sings this to Sinatra to prove that they were meant for each other. ""Strictly USA"" Probabley the best number everyone sings this at a party.""Upon St. Patrick's Day"" Kelly dances and sings to this great song. He sorta does this Irish gig. Kelly is truly the best dancer there ever was! This is one of the best numbers up there w/ Strictly USA.At the end Kelly, Sinatra, Williams, Garrett sing to Strictly USA as the finale. It really great! The dvd has the following special features which are 2 deleted numbers called ""Baby Face"" and ""Boys and Girls Like You and Me"". It also contains the trailers of Anchors Aweigh, On the Town, and the trailer for this movie. Also includes notes on Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. For some odd reason I love this movie! This is a must see if you are a Kelly fan"	1
"Warner Bros is putting out a series of ""Signature Collections"".  They are nothing of the sort.  They are studio collections. The word signature implies the best of the best. A signature collection of Hitch's work would not include several of these titles. The rarely seen Foreign Correspondent and I Confess. The failed comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The experimental Dial M for Murder and The Wrong Man.  The middling Stage Fright. Only Strangers on a Train and North By Northwest are signature Hitchcock.  Where are Psycho,  Vertigo, The Birds, Rear Window, Notorious, Shadow of a Doubt, Rebecca, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes and, purhaps even, The Lodger?  A signature collection would include all or most of these titles with North by Northwest and Strangers on a Train.  Of course this would oblidge the different studios to cooperate with each other. God forbid. Warner Bros is developing a reputation for shortchanging and lying to its customers.  You're much better off buying your favorite Hitchcock titles individually new or used"	0
The old DVD from 1997 looks better than the new HD version. I've compared the two, and the first DVD had good color saturation, dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette. The HD version has a blue-green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright. They also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy. The sound quality is better now, though, and the image of course is higher resolution.	0
Attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini-series of its day. It features a stellar cast including Powers Boothe as a crafty Roman leader who tries to use Attila to gain possession of Rome.Gerard Butler is Attila, the Hun,and he is everything about Attila in this role, never was an actor better suited. His character is sharp, passionate, determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film. He brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with Boothe even more dynamic.This is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes	1
"I'm puzzled as to why anyone should pay $59.39 for these three DVDs that currently retail on Amazon for $11.24 (Signs), $14.99 (Unbreakable), and $26.99 (Sixth Sense*) totaling $53.22?  *There is also a less expenseive ""Collector's Version"" of the Sixth Sense that only costs $14.99 if you'd rather not pay the $12.00 for the ""Vista Series"" extras.I'm also skeptical as to whether the version of Unbreakable sold here has as much content as the Vista series edition sold seperately that contains 2 discs (I assume this edition does not because this box set only includes 3 discs, 1 per movie).  I love the movies, but where's the price break on buying them all together when the package is $6.17-$18.17 more than purchasing these DVD's seperately???"	0

"If you've read the book this movies is EXTREMELY loosely based on, you will understand why the movie is so horrid. It's beautiful to look at, but that is all. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, but it looks more like a bunch of kids playing dress up than a film about a Queen of France. This movie completely ignores the Revolution, Marie Antoinette's arrest, and murder. In short, the movie ignores anything that is not pretty, girlish, and light. There is so much fluff and teen angst that it's hard to locate any fact in the film at all. Do we really need a 10 close-up of Kristen Dunst wistfully lazing about her apartments after she meets a handsome man? Even one scene like this is bad enough, but it happens over and over. We see kids at play more than adults with real problems, and the actors and soundtrack only reinforce this feeling. There is shopping, food, dress up, and flirting, but minus a handful of very short scenes, no real account of the lives of the King and Queen of France. There was little in the way of dialog, and sadly much of what there was was murmured while Dunst flounced around in her pretty dresses. There is so much historical inaccuracy in the film that it's almost pointless to try to listen to the dialog. For instance, the Dauphin and 2 brothers, which we are told in the book the film is ""based"" on. However, in the film, the brothers are combined into one, very inaccurate character. Marie Antoinette also had 2 sons, not one as the movie will tell you. I don't mind some changes for the sake of drama, but ignoring 90% of a historical account and then insisting that your movie is factual is ridiculous. The main actors are also terrible. The supporting cast, such as Rip Torn, and Marriane Faithful, is wonderful. They only serve to make Kirsten Dunst look that much worse. No one bother to act French, or like the poised rulers-in-training that their character were. The movie is so obviously a veichle for Dunst that it's sickening. There is just too much of her on the screen with not nearly enough reason for her to be there. Remember the 10 minute scene I described where she does nothing but smile? It keeps happening. It gets very, very old. It feels more like a photo shoot for Dunst than a film. I usually like Kirsten Dunst, but not in this film. Overall, the film looks and feels more like a music video and should have been one. There just isn't enough going on to warrent the film's length, and it's really geared towards young girls who love pretty dresses, food, and shopping, but have no taste for fact. It's a chick flick at it's worst, and it makes a mockery of the life of such an important person. It's very hard to believe that this came from the same person who wrote and directed films like ""The Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation"""	0

The freestlye section at the end is fun to watch, but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video"	0
"It seems to me there's a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era. I'm not arguing it's either better or worse than others, it just feels different and very distinctive. In this light, ""Wall Street"" reminded me vividly of ""No Way Out"" for instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and several De Palma films. Don't ask me why. It just does.Useless considerations apart, ""Wall Street"", directed by always controversial Oliver Stone, pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away. They always burn out, in a snap of fingers. And bigger they are, harder they fall, right?The story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen, featuring a bright young ""sport"", Bud Fox (played by Charlie Sheen) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life. He wants more, and hotshot Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become - powerful, vicious, influential and a sure winner. By sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence, Bud sneaks into Gekko's office and tries to prove his value to him. From here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average - but rather well executed in this particular instance - story of the young proteg who rises to the top at breakneck speed until, unexpectedly, something shatters his bond to the master. Something that hits home and makes Bud question his beliefs. What this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie, so I'll let that for you to find out if you didn't see it yet.All the acting is quite superb, especially the relationship between Gekko and Fox. Martin Sheen - who is Charlie Sheen's father both in real life and on the screen - is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work, not selling out and not letting others - and yourself - down. He reminds me of Donald Sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he's on screen a couple of minutes at a time.If you like high finance intrigue, big guys pulling the strings on each other, twists and turns, then ""Wall Street"" is probably essential. And it will probably give you an excuse to read Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"""	1
"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"", the second Harry Potter film in the series, was the first bit of the Harry Potter phenomenon I was every exposed to. I'd kind of avoided the boy wizard before then, but after seeing it those couple of years ago, even though I didn't entirely follow what was what and who was who, I realized it was pretty entertaining. After reading the second book recently, I picked up the DVD and watched it again. The series gets a little darker, like the books do, but unlike the book, I don't think the jump is as large, which I reckon is a good thing. Though I prefer the first film, it's still good to watch.It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) second year at Hogwart's wizards school, and after a shaky summer, he returns to find himself in the midst of a sinister plot. It seems a certain Heir of Slytherin has opened the legendary Chamber of Secrets, loosing a monster that is wandering about petrifing students, literally! Many fingers point to Harry, Harry's finger points to Malfoy, and Ron's wand... well that doesn't point at all, as its broken and backfiring. What's this all got to do with the mysterious trails spiders, haunted toilets, a rogue Quidditch bludger and a self-flagellating house elf? Can Harry, Ron and Hermione figure things out?All the kids are a little bit older and a little bit wiser in this film, plus the boys' voices are breaking. In some scenes they're kind of croaky sounding, in other scenes they have their child voice, and in others their voices broken through, not neccesarily in that order. There's a couple of new kids, (like Colin Creevey) and they are just as well cast as the others. The new adults are well cast too. Though not my favorite performance of his career, Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh makes an interesting Gilderoy Lockhart, the vain second year dark arts teacher. He played it a lot more subtley than I expected him to. Ex-Fast Show comedian Mark Williams plays Mr Weasley, which I reckon was a great choice. I missed some of the cast from the last film though. You hardly see Warwick Davis (who plays Professor Flitwick), let alone hear him say anything, and John Cleese's Nearly Headless Nick, who has a rather significant deathday party in the book, has hardly anything to do here except get petrified.There were other things cut out too, like the catching of the garden gnomes at the Weasley's. The fans of the book will feel the absence more than the casual viewers though. Personally, I like to think of the Harry Potter films as illustrations to the books put into motion, rather like the pictures in the world of Hogwarts. They give an idea of what the book would look like, an impression.Special features include an interview with author J.K. Rowling and script writer Steve Kloves, as well as interviews with all the kids and all the main adult actors. There's also slick virtual tours through Diagon Alley, Dumbledore's Office and Gilderoy Lockhart's Classroom (a tour that turns out to be just as pretentious as he is, complete with gushing praises from the narrator). There's also a couple of games: you can visit the Chamber of Secrets after answering some Harry Potter trivia, you can drive the flying car through the forbidden forest (which I found frustrating but addictive). There's also a trivia game about what spell does what too. Unlike the first DVD, you don't have to beat any games to access the deleted scenes, you're able to go to them straight from the main menu. Just as well, there's 19 of them, and some of them are pretty significant. Notable scenes include Harry's close encounter with the Malfoys in the dark magic shop, Harry discovering that Filch is taking wizard lessons by correspondence. I wish they'd left some of these scenes in, particularly the ones where Harry Potter questions his nature, is he a good wizard or a bad wizard. That was some mighty fine character development cut there! There's also a gallery of design drawings and a section called ""Colin Creevey's Darkroom"" where you can select pictures of various characters, then play them in a slideshow of sorts.Apparently there's a whole stack of stuff in the DVD ROM features, but I just couldn't get them to work on my laptop's DVD drive. Using InterActual player (the player that many Warner Brothers films have you install to play their DVDs), it says there is a script error, and when I tried Windows Media Player 9 and Cyberlink PowerDVD 4.0, though it ran the DVD and everything else with it fine, the DVD acted as if it wasn't in a DVD ROM drive, telling me that if I put the DVD into my PC's drive I'd get all these wonderful features. It was in my DVD drive! Aggh! It IS in a DVD drive. Maybe its just my type of laptop (BenQ DH5100U, 1.5 Gigahertz). Ah well, it looked like it would have been really fun, especially for fans of the series.All in all, its definitely worth a look for Harry Potter fans, but I would recommend you read the book first"	1
Every time this movie comes on my husband (who is English) and I watch it and laugh our heads off.If you have ever been in an English train station,drinking weak,watery cups of tea out of dirty,cracked cups.Smelling mildew and stale cigarettes while you freeze to death you would see the humor in anyone being romantically moved while sitting there.And not to be crule,but these are not exactly a couple of sex-pots.The thought of two stodgy old English people being driven wild by their passion for each other is,well------------------ hilarious! I give it 5 stars for being so darn funny.Oh--- and the music---- PLEASE!!!!!!!!!! But it is worth watching for a good laugh	1
During my teenage years I was a fan of WWF wrestling and specifically, the Rock.  He was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest, most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV.  His talent in the ring was spot-on, and the Rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete.  He rarely made a mistake in the ring... but he made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to Hollywood.It's not that Doom is really a bad movie.  Sure, it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters.  It's just a normal, monster-shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense, and that's it.  I'm sure the movie would've been big had it been released 10 years ago.  Todays generation is probably sick of go-nowhere do-nothing action films such as Doom.  Okay, so it DOES go somewhere, but the film isn't really designed to build to an awe-inspiring creative story.  Doom is the kind of movie you don't really want to seek out- you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90-minute action fix, so you rent the movie, watch it, and then forget about it the next morning.  Of course, I'm sure you don't forget to rewind the tape because that's impolite.  The Rock never should have left wrestling.  It was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans (and the Rock means MILLIONS) really miss him.  Come back home, Rock.  Please	0

If you have read Harmon's acting resume online, then you know she has talent, she has the training, and the ability to really play a good dramatic role if one came along.  But being a mild conservative (Angie is a Republican) in Liberal Hollywood can useually mean that the film companies give her really medicore scripts to look at.  Good Advice was Bad advice for her.  It is miscast with two annoying stars; Sheen and Richards...and some of the worst scenes and dialoge ever in a movie.  It has no redeaming values at all and Angie deserves better roles then this.  This movie was made by Artiscan Films, which recently went into bankruptcy and is now Lions Gate Films, their films are still bad no matter the name change, and I still wait to see a better movie come to Angie Harmon	0
My son has watched  the first two AcceleRacers movies, but so far this is his favorite!  Great movie for little boys who love cars	1
I enjoyed Francis Veber's 'The Closet' - released in France in 2001 - for two reasons.  First, it features an all-star ensemble of French acting, certainly a tribute to Veber's skill as a director.  Just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the IMDB credits:Daniel Auteuil ....  Franois Pignon Grard Depardieu ....  Flix Santini Thierry Lhermitte ....  Guillaume Michle Laroque ....  Mlle Bertrand Michel Aumont ....  Belone, the neighbour Jean Rochefort ....  Kopel, the director Imagine a movie where the great Jean Rochefort gets slotted sixth.  Each of these six stars can carry a movie in France on their own back.  The fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to Veber's reputation.  His previous release, 1998's 'The Dinner Game,' was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece.  Actors get attracted to that type of skill.The second reason I got a kick out of watching 'The Closet':  I just learned that 'Bend It Like Beckham' writing partners Gurinder Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges are prepping a UK re-make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release, with Chadha at the helm.  Her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by Beckham's runaway success, so I feel like I'm in on a really great secret knowing she's working on a re-make.	1
"One could review Kingdom of Heaven on a lot of levels ... as an action packed medieval adventure/romance ... as a vehicle for some of your favorite actors ... or as a statement about humanity's less than perfect attempts to find spiritual meaning in life in a way that doesn't lead to warfare with people of differing points of view.  I was expecting mostly the first two ... and was pleasantly surprised to find a reasonable amount of the third.   My favorite quote from the movie summed up a powerful feeling I've had about spirituality for some time now:""God will understand, my lord. And if he doesn't, then he is not God and we need not worry.""  Why people so infrequently ask themselves whether the god they believe in really makes sense to their hearts or not, I don't know.  And when I heard these words coming from the screen, I realized ""someone out there understands ... we don't find God in books or doctrine or sermons ... we know God in our hearts, or not at all"".  This character looked to his heart and knew ... God will understand ... and anyone who doesn't is surely not God, no matter what someone else might claim. And if you loved the movie, you'll enjoy this DVD ... it's a classy widescreen handling of a film that's visually rich and deserves to be seen in it's cinematic format. With gorgeous scenery and delightful characters and costuming, I can't imagine watching such a visually appealing film in less than wide screen form.  "	1
When I first put this DVD in I noticed that they cut away the opening, then the movie starts and I can't believe my eyes as the quality of the DVD is even lower than my VCD version, this is just frustrating to watch. The subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie, the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time, the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can't even be read. Another thing is the audio, you can't switch between Cantonese and Mandarin like on my VCD, yes this too was fixed to cantonese only. There is no extra features, you might as well buy a VHS tape, which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality. It does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused VHS tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting &quot;customers&quot;(read victims)	0
this is NOT a good movie!  Bad acting, story, and picture!  I was hoping this would be the first anime of the 8man After dvd I had but Alass it was not.  Pass on this one unless U HAVE 2 have it	0
"Bob Crane shot to television stardom in the 1960s as the star of the television series Hogan's Heroes. However, while he was enjoying the life of a TV star, he was simultaneously delving into dark territory in his personal life - sexual promiscuity and deviance. Auto Focus tells the story of Bob Crane as a tragic cautionary tale of the dangers of excess.When the film opens, Bob (Greg Kinnear, in a fantastic performance) is about to hit the big time, and is a loving family man who doesn't drink or smoke. He attends mass on Sundays. One day on the set of Hogan's Heroes, though, his life begins to take a bit of a turn when he meets John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), a techno-guy with all the latest gadgets, including video equipment, which fascinates Crane.""Carp"" opens the door for Bob to unleash his inner desires, which both excite and frighten him. It begins innocently enough, sitting in on the drums at a strip club, but eventually Bob loses all self-control and ends up making pornographic videos of his exploits and frequently ""swinging."" All the while Bob refuses to admit that there's anything wrong with him; if you ask him, he'll tell you he's just a normal guy.After Hogan's Heroes came to an end, Crane took a job with a dinner theatre show, which allowed Crane and Carp to take their liaisons on a traveling show. As Crane's indiscretions get worse, his personal life deteriorates, as he divorces two wives (played by Rita Wilson and Mario Bello).Auto Focus has been expertly directed by Paul Schrader, who begins the film with bright, glossy colors, then as Crane goes deeper and deeper into his obsessions, the colors fade and the camera becomes unstable, just as Crane does. Kinnear gives the performance of his life, showing us an uptight man who is afraid of his sexual demons turning into an uptight man who lets them take over his life."	1
A woman who lives in an apartment in NYC and can't cook and doesn't have a baby must fool the owner of her magazine into thinking she really is the character she writes about. (She writes a very popular domestic advice column.) She succeeds, until a Navy hero wins the opportunity to spend Christmas with her in her house in Connecticut, enjoying her homemaking skills and meeting her baby. Problem is, she doesn't have any of those things. She borrows the house (from a man who wants to marry her), she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house, and she even borrows a baby. The unmaking beings when she tells the Navy man her child is a boy, and when he volunteers to give it a bath he discovers it's really a girl. Then the mother of the baby takes it back, and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks nothing like the first one. Then the woman is falling in love with the Navy man (and he with her) while the man from whom she's borrowed the house still believes she's going to marry him, and keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding.  It's a delightful movie. Very funny, and rich in both plot and character development.  Unfortunately, what probably makes it not a classic by today's standards, it is a bit plodding.  It does not move at the same pace as, for example, the movie Casablanca, with which it shares some of the same supporting actors	0
I was so excited when I read the reviews for this intermediate level Pilates tape. Thought I would purchase it for variety from my 'The Method' Pilates tape. I was very disappointed. The tape does not even allow you to get your heart racing much less to break a sweat. I didn't feel like I got a good tone workout. I actually wanted to fall asleep. I felt it was 40 minutes of stretch for an intermediate level student. I give two stars because I do believe he knows what is talking about in terms of form but I shall be passing this on to an elderly relative	0

"Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of ""Mississippi Burning"" or the anger and impunity of ""Ghosts of Mississippi"", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade ""Miss Congeniality"" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not ""a powerful film."" It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like ""Mississippis Burning,"" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies"	0
The beautiful young Brooke Shields plays 11/12 year old Violet, daughter of Hattie (Susan Sarandon) a New Orleans prostitute living and working in a brothel in 1917. Violet has been raised in the brothel and has not been to school and has known no other life or anything about the outside world. When she turns 12, her virginity is auctioned off. Brooke Shields' portrayal of Violet is poignant and beautiful. Her childish charms and innocence are so heart-wrenchingly sweet. The scene where she jumps up and down on the photographer's bed (very childlike) and asks him whether he will take care of her before throwing her arms around him and giving him small childlike kisses on the nose, forehead etc. and reciting that little rhyme really pulled at my heart strings! I just wanted to jump into the TV and give her a hug!! This, mixed with the seductive adult things that she also says in this scene (and others) is particularly poignant as we know that young Violet is merely reciting what she's heard from the prostitutes. The photographer also says that Violet doesn't know what she's saying. You just want to turn the clock back, hug Violet and give her a proper childhood! The photographer marries her because he's fascinated with her beauty, innocence and is concerned that she is only a child and should not be in a brothel becoming a prostitute. The part where he gives her a doll is poignant as she has already lost her virginity and it seems that he's trying to give back her childhood, sadly she's been exposed to too much, too soon in her life. Susan Sarandon and Brooke Shields are wonderful in this movie as well as Keith Carradine, the photographer. The art aspect & music soundtrack are amazing. This movie deals with a taboo subject seen through the eyes of a child as 'normal' which enhances poignancy and brings out the viewers maternal need to 'rescue' young Violet.	1
"    ""Incredible"" I saw one review describing this production.  The meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is NOT incredible.  It is slow, convoluted and uninspired.  No chemistry exists between the actresses, with no connection to the audience.    "	0
I have read many reviews stating that this remake is inferior to the orginal version of 1968. Granted, that version is marvelous. I have bought both versions and love them both. OK, it is difficult not to compare when watching. BUT I can't help wondering: if this version would have been the first I or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version, if people would have been complaining about that version?I can have different versions of Vivaldi's four seasons can't I? Actually for those among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them all (and I do understand that people can have preferences for one or the other). We would never say this or that piece is a remake of that version, would we? I have gone to the opera numerous times and watched Don Giovanni three times. Every time with different performers. Remake? Absolutely not.I think that the only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is the wish to make it, because is such a great play. So, logically this would not be a remake!Why can't we watch this version for what it is and let go of the other (splendid 1968) version when doing so? That done, I must say I understand why Alais is in love with king Henry. Patrick Stewart is a very fine actor and has magnificent voice which he uses  very well. He is a  very good match to Close's queen. I did not care for Richard, I thought he was not commanding enough, bit whiny. I think John is a difficult part to play to say the least and I didn't care for him either, too much the idiot. Geoffrey on the other hand is really conniving and very good. King Philippe: too much a boy, although he has moments when the interaction with king Henry makes him interesting. Alais:good enough. Which of the versions do I prefer? that is difficult. I have highly enjoyed both. I think the 1968 version has a sharper edge because of Hepburn and I prefer her to Close. This version has a more emotional and sometimes romantic (Alais and Henry) approach. I definitely prefer Stewart to O'Toole, who seemed too young for the role. I liked the way Stewart made us see Henry's  self confindence in his plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming (that is, until the end, when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem falling apart). O'Toole had a very serious approach all the time.On the other hand: Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton were both splendid. I think overall that the 1968 version has a better supporting cast. Which of the versions I watch, depends on the mood I am in. I think they are both good in their own way.	1

Millionaire Fredrick Loren played by a young Vincent Price invites five strangers to a party in the House On Haunted Hill. With his delectable wife Annabel in tow, he has set the strangers a task of sorts, if they can spend one night locked in the house he will give them $10,000 each, however there is a bit of a catch to this seemingly generous offer, the house has seen several brutal murders and is reputed to be haunted.One of the guests in the house was even related to one of the victims and he is emphatic that the whole house is haunted and that they are all doomed because of what they are doing.At midnight the door is locked and everyone in the house waits to see what will happen next, and very soon all are locked into a game of terror and murder as the House on Haunted Hill takes on a life of its own, but there is a twist in the tale that is deliciously surprising as it is fun.I enjoyed this film, it wasn't overly suspenseful, but there are enough scenes to make you jump every now and then, the special effects were none-existent and there was a lot of screaming and shrieking from the character Norah a young woman who appears to be being targeted by the ghosts in the house.All in all a hokum of a movie but great fun all the same.	1
"The Firms ""Super Body Sculpt"" is a 40 mins, 3 parts workout which is broken up into Upper Body, Lower Body, and Abs.  Each segment has its own warmup and cool down. It can be performed one segment at a time, or all together for a complete total body workout.  The Upper Body flies by quickly with pushups, lat rows and french presses and biceps.  The Lower Body section focuses a little too much on Squats, and by the end of your last leg press exercise, there are more squats  that will make you want to scream ""Enough"".  I found the Abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches, and too much on obliques.  The stablization exercises are a great bonus to this DVD, and are my favourite.  Overall it is very well instructed.  You can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough, especcially during leg presses and squats.  I usually do all three segments to get the full benefits I need, and this DVD is great as a beginners tool to a firm body"	1

"A hardcore legend in Mick Foley' wrestling career is spotlighted here on this DVD.  Foley will go down in history for being able to control the crowd, being violent & hardcore, and also being able to be one of the most loveable characters in wrestling.  This DVD is a great collection of violent matches involing Foley himself along with his famous promos & extra matches.Disc One:Cactus Jack vs. Big Van Vader - During a time where Vader was just killing his opponetts, Cactus Jack was able to hold his own and go toe to toe with Vader.  This also includes exclusive footage that was censored on TBS.Chicago Street Fight: Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne vs. Nasty Boys - This was one of the ""stiffest"" matches I've ever seen as these guys were legitlity brawling & hitting each other with the weapons and you just see at one point Cactus get his head cracked with a shovel on the floor.  Honestly, one of the best Nasty Boys matches I've seen.Cactus Jack vs. Sabu - This match was more about the post match brawl between the two than the match itself.  Foley admits before the match that the hype & reputation between these two set a standard that nobody could match.Cactus Jack vs. Chris Candido - One of Cactus's best ""wrestling"" matches eventhough it's not really anything memorable.Texas Death Match: Cactus Jack vs. The Sandman - Foley openily admits that this match wasn't pretty as Sandman got a concussion at the beginning & really threw everything off.  They would go on to have better matches (as seen on the ECW Cactus Jack DVD).Cactus Jack & Raven vs. Terry Funk & Tommy Dreamer - The classic ECW wild weapons brawl as they had everything including the kitchen sink.  It would get sick as you see things like Cactus sliceing Funk's arm with glass.  With cameo's from Taz & Bill Alfonzo, this is worth watching again & again.Cactus Jack vs. Mikey Whipwreck - Cactus' last match in ECW against the man he helped make a superstar.Disc 1 Extras:Post-Vader match interview - Interview a week after his match with VaderFalls Count Anywhere: Cactus Jack vs. Sting - This match has commentary from Coach & Foley where they talked about his storytelling throughout the match & his time in WCW.  This was Cactus' best WCW match in his opinion and it really is.  Action all over the ringside area along with great inring storytellin (watch him work on Sting's ribs).Cactus Jack spits on WCW Tag Team Championship belt - The promo Cactus did after this Sabu match showing that the WCW Tag Title didn't mean as much as his pride that he lost to Sabu.  This is followed by a Heyman promo regarding that match.The ""Cane Dewey"" Promo - Foley's favorite promo done during this ""anti-hardcore"" stint in ECW where he talks about the fans making a sign suggesting that Sandman canes his 5 year old son.""Anti-Hardcore"" promo - Another promo where Foley talks down to the ECW fans for being so bloodthirsty.Cactus Jack vs. Sabu - The Cactus/Sabu rematch that includes commentary from Foley & Coach.  This match is better quality (both in video & in ring action) than the previous one.Mick Foley's ECW Farewell Speech - Foley says goodbye to the ECW fans.""Jack"""" Foley & Les Thornton vs. British Bulldogs - Mick's WWE debut that results in his having a dislocated jaw thanks to the Dynamite Kid.WWE Confidential feature - Mick talks about all the charity work he did during his 18 month absence in WWE and what led to his coming back to WWE.Hidden Easter Eggs:Mick Foley jumps off the roof of his house (On disc one, go to the ""Extras"" menu, highlight ""Main Menu"" and press the left arrow twice.)Dude Love Entrance Video (On disc one, go to the ""Chapters"" menu.  Highlight ""Cactus Jack vs. Chris Candido"" and press the right arrow.)Disc 2Introducting Mankind - One of the Mankind ""dungeon"" promos he did before his debutMankind vs. Shawn Michaels - This was Foley's best match of his career and probably the best match of 1996.  HBK's high flyin' lucha libre influenced style mixed with Mankind's hardcore daredevil style made for one hell of a match.Falls Count Anywhere: Cactus Jack vs. Triple H - Tables, trash cans, and weapons galore in this brawl.  One of the best matches in RAW history Mick Foley vs. Terry Funk - A throwback to their ECW brawls as both of these wrestlers are just using their own bodies are wrecking machines.  Stone Cold on commentary just adds to the craziness of this match.Dude Love vs. Stone Cold - The best match in the history of Dude Love as it's another brawl all over ringside.  McMahon, Brisco, Patterson, and Undertaker all have cameos in this match.Mankind vs. The Undertaker - Foley's most memorable performance as he takes a beating that you have to see to believe.Mankind vs. The Rock - Foley wins the title for the first time with help from Stone Cold.  This match itself isn't as memorable as their Survivor Series match or their later matches like the Halftime Heat match.Street Fight Match: Cactus Jack vs. Triple H - This is the match that catapulted Triple H into the bonified main event superstar that he is today.  Thumbtacks, barbed wire, and blood all over the place.Disc 2 Extras: Mankind teasers - Early Mankind promos that focued on his missing earMusic To My Ear - Another Mankind ""dungeon"" promoMind Games - This was a promo Mankind did before the Mind Games PPV where he insulted ECW (they were in Philidelphia) to insure the fans wouldn't cheer him.Jim Ross interviews Mankind - This was the interview that slowly started Mankind's face turn.The Birth of Mr. Socko - Mankind visits Mr. McMahon in the hospitalMick and Al Snow in Vegas - They're stalked by a fan More Mick and Al in Vegas - Mick and Al ride the rides, join a lounge band and visit a gentleman's club Commissioner Foley & Kurt Angle - The Commish books a match Hidden Easter Eggs:Chef Boyardee commercial (On disc two, on the ""Chapters"" menu, highlight ""Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind"" and press the left arrow twice.)DX skit ""Have A Bad Day"" (On disc two, on the ""Extras"" menu, highlight ""Birth of Mr. Socko"" and press the right arrow twice.)

My brother is Cameron Fry and it wasn't until his first year in college that he found his Ferris Bueller.  This is a classic that every high school student should see.  It's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best.  It's easy to tell from this film that Matthew Broderick was destined to be a star	1
While it is certainly fun to watch just to see the performers,this HISTORY OF ROCK simply doesn't jell as a whole.By trying to explain the evolution of the music,the pleasure gets lost along the way.If you are a rock connaisseur,you won't learn many new things if you watch this.What you should do is take it as a starter point and then go further with documents who gets deeper with one particular field(ex:MOTOWN or BRITISH INVASION).As it is,it tries to cover too much ground at once and still manages to forget a few artists like EMERSON,LAKE AND PALMER and KING CRIMSON among others.It costs me $80 dollars (CANADIAN money)for this 5 dvd set, which is too much for what it's worth.Rent it and enjoy the clips	1
The Shipment was fast also the Email Response before.The VHS was in very good shape, almost like new (as said in the description)	1
"If there ever was a movie more hyped in 2005 it was ""History of Violence"" On critics top ten list, everyone was talking about the performances of Viggo and Maria and Ed, so I went into it with high expectations. Honestly it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't worth all the worship that the Hollywood community and critics heaped upon it either. The story of a humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood murderers, only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape of Ed Harris , who in my opinion had the best performance overall. Ed (Mr. Fogarty) is in the Mob and seems to think that Viggo (Tom) is Joey Cusack a former mobster who went missing after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants revenge. Tom, and his wife Edie (played by Maria Bello) have two children, a farmhouse, and a diner and Tom insist that he isn't Joey. The story goes on, dragging and dragging with tiny spots of violence and sex. Maria Bello has never been one of my favorite actresses, I think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde hair (evidence is in the movie) she brings the level of believability down and makes Viggo's performance seem like he is trying to make up for her lack of talent. We soon figure out that Tom is indeed Joey and after we say goodbye to Ed Harris's character (of which I was just disappointed to see, c'mon he was awesome!) Tom/Joey goes to see his brother, Richie (William Hurt) to make amends for disappearing, and soon realizes that Richie wants him dead. So more killing, more blood, and tom/joey is finally free of his past, if his family would take him back. Of course they do, really, his redemption is yawn worthy set around a dinner table (his daughter sets a place for him...) and the movie is over. There was no Aha moment, the action wasn't anything new, the story was predictable and the setting was ""been there done that"". Viggo is an amazing actor, and if there had been a better script he might have come across as more tortured and the Tom/Joey duality could have come off as truly horrific to change back into, the shift of reality was barely noticeable. Maria Bello, needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles where she is some tough, sexy, stringy haired ball breaker who is kinda motherly, it doesn't work for her, she cannot pull it off. So I don't recommend this movie, its slow, its disappointing and its not all it was cracked up to be"	0
Ladies in Lavender is a rare gem in the movie world of today.  This is a soft spoken tale that ignores age and looks to character.  Beautiful roles for older women may be hard to find these days and when a movie comes along with two such roles you could not ask for anything better than to have two wonderful Ladies, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, take on those roles.  This movie was adapted from a short story of the same title but its silver screen life comes from the actors who played their parts to perfection.The movie takes place in a small Cornish village where the viewer is given an immediate sense of isolation - perhaps isolation from life, from emotions and from vulnerabilities.  The sisters Ursula and Janet Widdington, played by Dench and Smith, spend a quiet, uninvolved existence, venturing out rarely.  But on one of their walks along the beach that they find a young man washed ashore after a storm.  A bit befuddled they nevertheless take this young may into their home to help him recuperate.  This one act of kindness leads to unexpected consequences for we see that age is not a barrier to unleashing emotions, feelings that have been hidden for so many years.  It is the ability of Dench and Smith to portray these emotions, these feelings, for the camera that make this movie sing.  And the melody of the movie is also carried nicely by the supporting roles played by Daniel Bruhl and Natascha McElhone.  Together these actors make this move work on several levels to give the viewer a splendid evening's entertainment.	1
"How can you rate something that hasn't been released?  Especially since Lionsgate RUINED Season 5 by releasing the shortened syndicated versions while still writing on the box ""The Complete 5th Season"".  Debbie Harry is credited on the box while her scene was omitted.  This along with many others...They completely ruined the boxed set by issuing shortened, crappy syndicated episodes.  This is coming from a huge W&G fan, or should I say K&J fan"	0
   This movie is just terrible; even more than MOST of the predictably terrible films in this genre.  Women with terrible haircuts, dirty homes filled with poor taste in furniture, jobs a 16 year old would have - or no jobs at all, awkward behavior, barely able to function socially...UH+GH!  The truth is, there are gay women out there who look great, have beautiful homes, have very progressive and meaningful careers, have talent and are entertaining and sexy.  WHO SAYS this is representative??  Not in MY world it isn't.  I am so sick of these painful displays of us.  Anyone who gave it over 2 stars is childishly defending the genre in general, and not talking about this stinker of a film.       The filming is poor, the sound is dull...don't waste your time. 	0
"I just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife.  Here are my gut impressions:First, very little is true to the book.  That's not really a gut impression.  That's the impression I got hearing my wife say ""That's not in the book...that's not in the book...""Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling.  It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie.   I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching.  You get to see... A kid chasing a ticket through a train, A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train, A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train,(Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!)OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have...A train sliding out of control on the ice,A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice,A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the ""coaster tycoon"" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole. Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have...A train car running out of control through Santa's village,Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then...Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf.  Ho ho ho.At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out!  It's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion.  You know it's awful but you can't look away!  And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this.  It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up.  My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn't.So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume.  Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters one bit.  Whatever a ""character driven"" story is, this is the opposite.  Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little.I'd rather set up my old American Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I read the book to my kids.

This was the first DVD I purchased after I bought my DVD player (I know, it took me a while to get one). I had never seen the movie before, but amazon[.com] reccomended it so I took the chance. It had the perfect amount of predictability and comedie and romance. It's the same story line that gets used a million times and never grows old. Boy and girl are best friends. Girl likes boy, but boy likes a different girl. Boy asks for help from girl to get the other girl. Boy realizes he's in love with friend girl just in time to stop her from leaving	1
"Pick any house on any street. Pick any random two people(Man and Woman), give them a script and let them go wild.I promise you could make this movie work better than the producers.Nothing in this movie stood out and everything about it was boring.The acting and settings in this movie are just horrible. By the end you WANT everyone to die just to become interested.Now, I don't usually give bad ratings and I really like ""B"" horror films, but the lack of effort here is unbelievable.Just nothing to interest me"	0
"""The Door In The Floor"" is difficult to like, even, (or perhaps especially), if you're a fan of John Irving's book, ""A Widow For One Year,"" which was the source of this film. The movie is dark, depressing, & slow-moving. It also showcases the least likable characters from the book. To make matters worse, it focuses only on the first third of the novel's story, which leaves us with an entire movie about an alienated, (& alienating), couple's suffering. The film is completely devoid of the novel's interesting & more enjoyable journey through this tragic period of a family's life & into the more fulfilling chapters in the lives of characters who aren't well developed in the film, but who are central to the book's satisfying end to an otherwise hopelessly sad story! This may give you an idea why the film wasn't very successful with audiences. The theme is of deep personal loss and the devastating effects it can have on people. Unfortunately, the film version of the story concentrates almost entirely on the agony experienced by the parents, played by Jeff Bridges & Kim Basinger, in the aftermath of the accidental death of their two teenage sons. It wallows in the empty chasm that's grown between them & delves into the sad, meaningless, & even cruel love affairs they each engage in, in vain attempts to ease their sorrows & escape the pain of the love lost between them & of course, the greatest loss, the loss of their sons. The film also highlights the rather ugly way this couple inflicts damage upon the people they use for this purpose. And finally, we witness the pain of their very young daughter, who was born out of yet more of the parent's attempts to fill their empty, sad lives, and we're treated to a view of her pitiful childhood, growing up with parents who truly ""aren't there."" The greatest mystery for me is why the screenwriter chose to tell just a small slice of the story of this great novel, and even worse, why they chose to ""bring to life"" only the most depressing and frankly least interesting parts of it! If the theme of loss is one you're very interested in, you might find this movie quite affecting.  As for me, a great fan of the book, I can only hope that someday someone makes a better & more complete adaptation of this great book. It's not nearly as desperate & sad a story as this film version!On subsequent viewings I've grown to appreciate this film a bit more. Taken completely apart from the novel, it's not a ""bad"" film. Undoubtedly, the performances are wonderful, however little fun they are to watch."	0
I'm Not sure if anyone has pointed this out BUT the voice's for paul and company is not their own , these were in fact voice actors and they did a very good job too . This was also confirmed by paul proir to the movies release	1
Many people criticized this movie for having no plot. Which is a result of many people criticizing the first for being too complex. There's just no pleasing some people but this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a formidable villain. Dougray Scott is pretty much one of the worst villains ever and a poor representation of Scottish actors.John Woo uses some wonderful Australian scenery but fails to inject any sense of excitement to the fight scenes. The gun battles look too damn staged and the fist fights are all done in slow-motion, which robs them of any realism or hardcore. Seeing as how this is a PG-13 the action is also pretty damn tame. Which is a shame since Woo is a pro at this. You hardly see any bullets even enter bad guys never mind exit. It's all done off screen. If people wanted tame violence why on earth did they hire Woo to direct? It's a bit puzzling.Although it IS tame it is still darker and harder than the original. But the duff biochemical warfare plot is pure video game crap. I can't believe Robert Towne had a hand in writing this. It's like a rejected plot to a Solid Snake PS1 game. There's seems to be some focus on making it a James Bond/Die Hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material and offering us any iconic or memorable set-pieces.Another major thing that is wrong with this movie however is Zimmer's score. For a movie that is 124 minutes long we get about 30 minutes of music. Zimmer is known for his talent of creating ambient and versatile music. But NONE of that is present in MI-2. This was movie was made around the time of his decline into mass-produced soulless stuff. Which is also a shame.It's the wrong plot, the wrong director and the wrong approach that turns this into a movie for idiots. They really under-estimated the audience and fumbled the ball with this one.John Woo's original cut was 3.5 hours long. None of that footage is on this new 'Special Edition' DVD. What a waste	0
As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, this US release has replaced the original source music. But the Region 2 version has been released without these cuts, so for everyone with a multiregion player, I'd suggest using amazon.co.uk to buy a copy there instead	0

This is not a chick flick movie.  This is not a movie for baseball fans.This movie is for everyone.  It has romance, It has sports, It has a great soundtrack.  It makes you laugh.  It makes you cry.  It makes you think.  It is a feel good movie. 	1
"They do't make musicals like this anymore. Well,they don't really make musicals anymore, do they? They used to make them, made them well and they came out like ""Down Argentine Way."" The plot is just enough to keep your interest but the music is bright,costumes lavish and not a few laughts. The major players- Betty Grable and Don Ameche- are as engaging as usual.Carmen Miranda makes her US film debut and sings, dances and mispronounces her way to stardom. The 20th Century Fox role players appear (Charlotte Greenwood, J. Carrol Naish, Henry Stephenson)and add to the fun. "	1

I owned the original VHS version...I quickly gave it to a friend of mine, free of charge.Eric Johnson may be considered a guitar great (I don't get it), but he has the personailty of a shoelace and it is aptly demonstrated in this instructional video. Some people just aren't good teachers, no matter how great a guitarist they are. As an added bonus, his guitar is drenched in reverb throught the entire video, even during specific examples & demos! Say what?Finally, the length of the video was way too long (or at least it felt that way. It took repeated viewings for me to get therough from start to finish).Throw in a mind-numbing finale/lecture about patch cables, cable length, pick gauge, strings, theories on physics and you get Eric Johnson: Total Electric Guitar - Agonizing to watch & absolutely God-awful. Stick w/ Brian Setzer (THE rockabilly instructional bible), James Burton (Hello.....Elvis' guitarist!), Yngwie J.(THE only instructional video you need for precision shredding), Danny Gatton (1 & 2: encyclopidias of all styles) or B.B. King: Bluesmaster (extremely in-depth analysis/demos of B.B.'s style by B.B.) Instructional videos/DVDs. Even if it's not your style, these are highly informative, educational & entertaining. I highly recommend these	0
"I was also disappointed with this DVD, as is seemed to be a popular choice among amazon shoppers.  I think the title, ""Yoga for Beginners"" is misleading, as this DVD contains many advanced yoga routines.  Also, on the back of the DVD it said it contained a ""Core Workout 20 Min."" but no such workout is actually on the DVD!I purchase the ""Pilates for Inflexible People"" at the same time as this DVD, and I much prefer it.  Although, I wish I'd known that two of the workouts from the pilates DVD were on the yoga DVD before I bought them both."	0
Horror movies are a dime a dozen now, and nothing really speical about them anymore. Sad to say, considering its probably my faviorte genere. This movie was a disappointment from the start. Whoever did editing on this movie needs to be fired. I mean they are standing there talking, and it just cuts away when you think something is going to happen. I didnt watch the whole movie, it sucked that bad. I bought this movie used, and I'd gladly give it back to the owner free of charge.	0
...But I'm giving season four 4 stars, because there aren't any subtitles in this set. They also didn't have subtitles for season 3, but they did had subtitles for seasons 1 & 2. Strange, huh? However, the quality of the DVDs are fine and the episodes, of course, are wonderful to watch. At the end of this season the Meathead is supposed to graduate and move out for good, but he decides to stay with the Bunkers a little longer, so he can get his Masters degree.   There aren't any special features or anything in this DVD set, but as long as the episodes are uncut, I'm happy. If you're a fan of the show, this DVD set is a MUST-HAVE!	1
I live in South Africa where the series appeared 20 years ago.Thanks to Amazon I was able to relive the wonder of Archie Bunker where each episode provides laughs from one of the family,each of whom is brilliantly cast.I have series 3&4 and now want 1&2.Don't wait any longer,24 episodes of absolute delight await you	0
Watching this movie is a very bizarre experience.  Having attended high school in the countryside, close to large clusters of Amish farms, I had heard stories from my friends at school about rumspringing Amish teenagers.  I dismissed most of them as rumor.  This movie confirmed that those wild stories I heard were probably true.  A very intruiging look at the flipside of a lifestyle most Americans cannot even begin to comprehend.  Worth a rental at the very least	1
"The folks at PBS deserve the gratitude of photography teachers and students everywhere. Taking on subject matter as impossibly broad as photography in 20th Century America? This documentary covers-- sometimes comprehensively, sometimes briefly-- virtually every important topic germane to the field of study, from Pictorialism to Straight Photography, from fashion to the scientific. Along the way, we are introduced (or reintroduced) to what has been the medium's most important uses: journalism and documentary. ""A Century of Images"" is as instructive for the novice as it may be reaffirming to those already familiar with much of the material. Underlying a wealth of historical examples and anecdotes are the two twin themes that raise this effort above the mundane: concern over the ethical issues photographs present, and the effects of mechanically produced images in the post-industrial age on the psyche of our nation. These themes manifest themselves in ways that are often revelatory and moving. One memorable example: the way Edward Curtis's images of Native Americans are placed into context by a woman who appreciates them, yet yearns for more images that show her people the way they ""really were."" Sections on war photography cover WWI, WWII, Vietnam and the Gulf War with compassion, and work as excellent visual aids to discussions on todays situation in Iraq. Another bonus: the section on the transition to a digital age has not yet outlived its usefulness.Until I was able to buy this fabulous history on DVD, my biggest complaint was that while using the VHS version, I had all kinds of problems locating the various scenes I wanted to pull out to show my photography and visual communication courses at the university where I teach. Now that I can happily locate scenes at will using the DVD menu, I can direct my ire at its few but significant omissions and shortcomings. More on Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus please . . . . they were pretty damned influential."	1

"How could Mr. Cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody?The production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuos, but the script and dialogue are so banal, the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another. (Including Leo, who was so good in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" in 1993 when I didn't yet know who he was, I thought he was really a cute little retarded kid... yet in ""Titanic"", there's just nothing there--- or nothing permitted). Talk about a SHIP wreck!!Only the two studio-backed block voting resulted in the record-tying Oscar wins/nominations.  "	0
"We expose our babies/toddlers to a wide variety of cultural sources, in several languages.  Therefore, having seen similar products it seemed logical to purchase this one, given it is touted as a multilingual introduction to their environment (our little ones are trilingual: English, Spanish and ASL, and they ignore us in all them!).  Big mistake.  The video not only reinforces but solidifies the sexist portrayal of love so prevalent in other Baby Einstein (BE) items.  In earlier BE products one could see only female hands manipulating objects as they presented them on screen.  Male hands were never present.  This video goes many steps furhter by featuring male figures only in the background, or at best, an elderly man briefly interacting with a child.  Everywhere else you see multiple females lovingly playing, caring or otherwise being nurturing to children.  Males are only seen (with the exception of a black couple in bed while kids jump to play with them) in a distant background in entirely detached attitudes, or at least distant, dry and quiet poses, such as talking with a much older (male) child.  It is as if they are shown there as part of the domestic landscape, however as movable and inane as potted plants, whom you can move and place at will.  I felt insulted by this condescending and disqualifying view of male love and nurturing abilities.Asides, when you go into the Spanish version, it is (for a professionally produced video) riddled with mistakes.  Three objects are mislabeled.  In the first, when a cup - the plastic or paper tall type , not the coffee and saucer version, it is called ""la taza"", when in reality it should be ""el vaso"", as unlike English, where it is interchangeable ""vaso"" is  the specific word for that item.  The second - much worse instance, still in the kitchen was to introduce a bowl.  There, the clueless scripter translated it as ""el bol"", a clear and poor corruption of the English word into a one commonly used in Spanglish, instead of calling it ""tazo'n"", as its correct name is.  The last one I saw was in the yard (I'm suprised they didn't call it la yarda!: ""Looka mami! get la troca and go a la marketa a buy a boncha de carrotas!"").  This time they called an obvious swing (two ropes and a seat in between) ""la hamaca"", when in reality hamaca means hammock.  Fortunately, we are native speakers amnd are abel to catch these pitfalls, but many people relies upon these products to teach their kids other languages.  In sum I was discusted with the whole thing.   "	0

"Alright....own up. Which idiots are responsible for the release of this ""Musicals"" collection?Since when have ""Pinky"" and ""Island in the Sun"" been musicals?????These two movies are hard hitting dramas with a similar inter-racial relationships theme.Would someone please tell them that, just because Harry Belafonte sings the title song over the credits, this does NOT make ""Island in the Sun"" a musical.I suppose in their book, because Shirley Bassey sings the title song over the credits, this makes ""Goldfinger"" a musical too ??It makes me so mad that we have idiots in charge of releasing these great old movies who have no idea what they are doing.It seems to be a case of ""..oh, just grab  six movies off that shelf and lump them together."".If they don't know which are the best titles to release in a certain set, why don't they ASK someone who does know?"	0

This movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices. he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly. this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share, i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world. i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday. its a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone. you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about.... growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn't as bad as it sounds. plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell. Its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era.	1
"I really like this DVD - you can get some really good exercise in only 10 minutes.  Lara does not waste time on lengthy explanations between exercises, and she moves quickly from one exercise to another.  I like the variety of exercises - there are not too many rep's on any one exercise, which keeps the workout from being monotonous.  This is the first ""programmable"" exercise DVD I've used, and I like being able to pick and choose which exercise segments to do and in which order - this makes it easier for me to get motivated to start (and once I start, I'm fine)"	1
I think if Charles Bukowski, Dylan Thomas, and Fellini collaborated on a piece of writing, it's possible they would have come up with this screenplay. This movie is exciting because it's soooo different from anything I've ever seen. Deliciously non-linear. The substance abuse aspect is a little overdone but that's the destiny of &quot;artist movies&quot;. I loved hearing the dialog, and Kristofferson's acting is the best I've ever seen by him. Anything so daring and so unconventional will naturally upset some people (like other reviewers here), but if you ask me that only validates the work. If ever I go to New York City, the Hotel Chelsea will be at the top of my list of places to visit. My favorite lines were by the crazy guy in the elevator, who after claiming to have had a conversation with Dylan Thomas said that ghosts naturally reside in places like the Chelsea because people will listen to them there. The DVD extras contain a couple of quirky interviews, one with director Ethan Hawke and the other with Robert Sean Leonard who plays a deeply troubled folksinger in the film	1
I was disappointed with this longer version of The Mill on the Floss.  I thought, being BBC and a long version it would be a definitive one, but I have to agree with the other reviewer.  This version left out some very important events, and emotions seemed washed out rather than passionate and moving. I like long movies, but this dragged because it just doesn't hold your attention.  The 1997 Masterpiece Theatre version is so much more powerful, and keeps all important events intact, spending less time on Maggie's mother worrying about the fate of her china, and more on character and plot development, with a very haunting score.  I really hope the other version is released on DVD-if so, I will probably donate this one to the library, because I can't quite see myself rewatching it. I would rather read the book, instead	0
"This DVD is nothing more than a recycling of 3 previous episodes of the show.  For a ""best of"" volume, I expected much shorter segments from many more episodes that actually did contain what the DVD case advertises, namely ""the best of"" and the ""scariest moments.""  In my opinion, this volume fails to deliver what it promises.  I am definitely a fan of the series, and I know there are much better moments it has to offer.  About the only thing you can really expect to enjoy on this DVD are some fairly decent examples of EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon).  Even though the DVD is fairly inexpensive, I don't think it's worth the cost"	0
"A boy has a college interview at a small academy and meets the other guys there.  And they talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk.  They go to classes and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk. Then they go down to dinner and and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk.  Then nighttime comes and the boys all feel themselves up.  In other words, this movie is vintage DeCoteau.  It defies all known logic (the boy shows up for his college interview, is accepted immediately and somehow moves in the same day with no luggage or discussion with parents), has lame effects and lots of half naked boys.  It's hard to tell if this is a commentary on the Catholic Church scandals or just another excuse to show writhing youg men in bed. Definitely another laugh riot from the director of such ""classics"" as Leeches and Leather Jacket Love Story"	0
"Is anyone else having issues with these discs? When you first place the discs in the player, it skips over the main menus. Then the ""menu"" button will only start and stop the episode selected, but it will not return you to the main menu. There is no Spanish or Portuguese dubbed audio on the discs (despite what the menus and packaging claim) and the episodes automatically play with Spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned ""off."" The only way to avoid this is to choose ""other"" subtitles with the remote.

I'm exchanging my discs immediately, but I have a feeling they might all be bad. Anyone else hear about these issues"	0
I don't know what the last poster was thinking... This DVD goes to the top of my worst quality list. I wouldn't complain as much but they are advertized as &quot;Digitally Remastered,&quot; which is obviously meaningless. &quot;Long John Silver&quot; is soft-focus, borderline blurry, throughout; marred with constant flecks and blobs; and has countless vertical scratches that score the full image. It's like watching some old home movie you found in a trunk. Haven't viewed &quot;Captain Kidd,&quot; but a cursory scan indicated it too is in poor condition. If that's the best the films come, and there's no money for clean-up, so be it. But get that misleading &quot;Digitally Remastered&quot; off the box. That's a hoodwink if ever there was one	0
"The fifteen-year-old Duncan (Emile Hirsch) and his laconic father Edgar Mudge (Richard Jenkins) are reeling after the death of the most important person in their life. Duncan's mother and Edgar's wife died suddenly, whilst biking some farm eggs to her neighbor.  An alcoholic, she was the glue that tethered this family together, and her death has left Duncan and Edgar emotionally fragile and at a loss.  It isn't only his wife's passing that is bothering Edgar; he notices that Duncan's a ""different"" kind of boy - sensitive, kindly and delicate. Duncan constantly dotes on his pet chicken and dresses in his mother's clothes, perhaps in an effort to stay connected to him mom.  At church - where he sings out of tune  - a neighbor in their tiny farm community comments on how Duncan is the spitting image of his mom. Duncan is soft, not in an effeminate way; it's just that he has an intuitiveness and a compassion that places him at odds with some of the older and rougher boys, who mock him, and call him ""weird"" and question his sexuality, something he's already tormented over. Was Duncan a mama's boy? Well, we're not really sure. Obviously there was incredible love between them both, but it's a love that his father is unable to replicate. Edgar worries about his son and he loves him dearly, but he's is clueless about how to help him. He tries to get him to help out around the farm in an effort to toughen him up. He also encourages Duncan to go out with his older friends, the ringleader of which is Perry (Tom Guiry), a butch and macho town stud who likes to brag about his sexual conquests. Perry's bravado is a cover-up for his scary feelings toward Duncan, and it's only a matter of time before their relationship reaches a crisis.Mudge Boy is the perfect example of understatement, a tale of bourgeoning same sex attraction, and also a titular exploration of the isolation of farm life. Deeply religious, Edgar could be the fire and brimstone type of father; instead he's a thoughtful, considerate and caring man, who is at a loss at how to deal with his eccentric son. Hirsch, who projects a shy modesty, is perfectly cast as Duncan - a boy who is somewhat out of his depth with the people around him, an outcast with many quirks and eccentricities. At times, Mudge Boy can be difficult to watch, there's a quasi-rape scene, where the result of some teenage sexual experimentation reaches an ugly climax. But writer-director Michael Burke is always sensitive to his subject matter, beautifully rendering his protagonists' dysfunctions and setting them against a bucolic backdrop of Vermont farm land with it's meadows, tumbling down barns and cow patches.  Whether Duncan is sweetly ingratiating himself and getting drunk with the local in crowd, or sucking on the head of his pet chicken, he's a character who many of us will probably be able to relate to. He's desperate to fit in, confused about his bourgeoning sexuality and is undoubtedly a troubled and confused soul. The final denouement, when Duncan is forced to confront the evils of small town bigotry is absolutely heart wrenching, as is the teary and world-weary reconciliation with his father.

"A French saying goes: ""The more things change, the more they stay the same.""  It appears that the ""historical"" epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that ""poetic"" license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth.  One of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is D W Griffith's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth.  Firstly, we all know that this Cameron dude did not start the KKK and that this organisation has its roots in Indiana and not South Carolina.  Secondly, the KKK is not the defender of the South and there is no need to ""purify"" the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by D W is ""preserve the Aryan race.""  Modern science, using cutting edge DNA research has already proved that we all come from the same African man about 60,000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well.  Like it or not, we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor.  Some of the portrayals of Blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys I found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie.Yes, this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content?  This is not akin to an Einstein discovering relativity folks; every single ""good"" thing about this movie would have been ""discovered/invented"" with or without D W. eventually and very probably very soon after.  Every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later, talented directors of the time.  The overall lies, attempts to justify racism and the murderous KKK more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie's great hall of fame.  They say that racists are not born but bred; this is why I'm not at all surprised at what D W Griffith has done here.  His father was considered a ""hero"" of the Confederate Army where he served as a Colonel.  I'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war, he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist.  This movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it's quite irritating to have to keep hearing Mendelssohn's overtures over and over again.  In conclusion, the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors' world view?  Also, do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message?  Like I said before none of the ""techniques"" that this film claims to have ""discovered"" are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway.  So the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good; D W Griffith's legacy/mess"	0
"After starting my 9/11 odyssey from ignorance to full blown ""WHAT!"" after ""Loose Change - 2nd Ed"" last year, I've watched and or read just about them all.  9/11: Press for Truth comes out on top, in my humble opinion, as the best 9/11 timeline presentation out there.  Nothing included that isn't in the mainstream press - just on the back page, and spread out over five years.  The film makes few of the outright accusations that ""Loose Change 2nd - Ed"" does towards any of the events or people involved in 9/11, but delivers more of damning argument that we've been lied to - there weren't just mistakes made, but distortions and deceit at the highest levels of our government.  I hope that we, the people, finally demand a real investigation and the truth comes out.  And the bad guys pay. Good movie"	1

This mediocre effort is disappointingly unfunny. Considering the comedic caliber of its two stars, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams, I was expecting a laugh riot, but that's not what this is. It's not their fault, it's the scriptwriter's. I guess maybe it was just one of those scripts that read funny on paper, but that humor just didn't translate to the screen, despite the best efforts of Mssrs. Crystal and Williams. They deserve better, and so do we	0
"This one is an old favorite of mine, which I pre-ordered on DVD the instant I learned it was available.  I have an old VHS recording of the film, which I have viewed many times.  I have also read the book many times, and I consider it to be Conroy's best work.This is the story of four young men at Carolina Military Institute, a fictional military academy located in South Carolina, which is of course a pseudonym for The Citadel, which is a fine military academy that really does exist.  The film is set in the 1960s.  The first black cadet (first year cadets are called ""knobs"" at the Institute) has just arrived.  A secret society within the Institute, known as ""The Ten"" has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the Institute, regardless of ability.David Keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet's designated mentor.  The plot moves at a fast pace, but nevertheless does not feel rushed.  Purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub-plots contained in the novel.  I feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete, and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries.  I liked the script, the acting, and the ending.  This is a wonderful film.  It is the type of film that most viewers will watch periodically over the years, and I am delighted that it will shortly be available on DVD."	1
"This DVD showcases a somewhat new (as of the 2001 recording) sound for Sade, with slightly poppier and quicker supporting music. However, Sade's voice adapts beautifully, and she is one of those singers who just doesn't need the standard studio treatment to sound tremendous. Her buttery, chocolate lyrics come through with mesmerizing clarity on this DVD.After a few years of owning this DVD, I still enjoy and am transfixed by the wonderful editing, sound, and lights on this DVD. I highly recommend it to add to your ""chill-out"" collection. No longer the jazzy Sade of yesteryear, the versatility of songs on this long (almost 2-hours?) dvd will keep you grooving for hours"	1
"This is a nice item to add to a collection of D&D trinkets, but in NO WAY is good. It is lacking in story and acting. A lot of the scenes were pleasant, but I was never ""compelled"" by the story.I would only recommend this to a hard core collector or a funny break from your current game.."	0
"This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about ""..never getting out of this small town.""?  I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie. "	0

well, Season 5 for me was a little bit of a dissappointment but still contain the character plot line (or the theme as many will call it) of Southpark itself.  Since buying this i watched it alot in the first month or two then dropped off.   My interest in Southpark was revisited with Season 6 (also available on DVD)  However,  If you like South Park or love it this is for you of course without saying.  However, If you just joining in you might want to get the package with the first 5 seasons all together, but this season was good	1
"The Decalogue is one of several excellent TV series by European directors that puts US TV to shame. Like Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage"" & ""Fanny & Alexander,"" von Trier's ""The Kingdom,"" Fassbinder's ""Berlin Alexanderplatz,"" Kusturica's ""Underground,"" and Petersen's ""Das Boot,"" The Decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to US viewers' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run. Unlike these other series, Kieslowski's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block (and characters from one episode may pop up in another).  The stories of The Dekalog are morality plays, but they are not re-enactments of The Ten Commandments, but rather inspired by them, and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two.  Kieslowski & Piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves (instead of contracting 10 of Poland's best up & coming director's to do each, as was initially planned), and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories.  I won't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so, and I feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them, so I will comment on Kieslowski's style. Kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature.  His films often tackle issues of political import, however he intentionally avoids making ""issue films,"" but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected, as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture. His views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in Poland before, during & after the Solidarity movement. Initially he started as a documentary film maker, but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects, he switched to his unique fictional style. This Facets 3-disc set of The Dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available, in that the picture quality is a little better, however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if Criterion had released this series. First, Facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu. To add to that, you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode, very annoying. Then the picture quality isn't as good as it could be. Not only is there evidence of flaws in the film (scratches and blotches), but the film isn't a true digital copy of the original series, but rather a copy of someone's PAL tape of the broadcast, so the image is no better than watching a VHS tape.  The picture is also cropped from the original, especially on the bottom. The picture at times jitters, especially during the ending credits. The English subtitles are minimal, at times missing dialogue, and can not be turned off. There are some nice extra features, particularly a broadcast from Polish television of an interview of Kieslowski with a number of Polish journalists. However the quality of the picture of this is worse than on The Dekalog, and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in English with no option to turn of the English dub & use subtitles instead. Apparently all of the other (imported) editions of The Dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition, which is inexcusable given the price"	0

As cute and talented as I think Hugh Jackman is, this production was a waste of time, space and money. Everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves.  The acting is bad, the script is horrendous and the CG people apparently think their stuff don't stink...which it does-badly.  It's not the worse movie I've seen, but it's surprisingly close.

"The perpetrators of a high-level corporate scandal (Masayuki Mori, Takashi Shimura, Ko Nishimura) are pursued by the illegitamate son (Toshiro Mifune) of a low-level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes.  This film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic, but the masterful director Akira Kurosawa is not content to let it rest there.  He draws out all the moral complexities of the situation, then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title.  The bad may not always go to prison for their crimes, but do they really ""sleep well?"	1

I have watched this movie along with many other Jet Li films. To be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection. I was so caught up in the title that I really was expecting much more from the film. But I was very disappointed to say the least. The movie takes place in the early eighties. When Gangs dressed in leather with chains, carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally. This was not the type of movie that I was expecting Jet Li to be in. If you want some real action packed Jet Li pick up the Contract Killer which will give you alot more for your money TRUST ME you want be disappointed	0
I bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and I was VERY disappointed. First off, it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music- but the background exercisers really bug me too. Not only that, the moves are strange. She does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music. I found my neck hurt A LOT after that. The leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself. The ab section too was so old school, I was hoping to find some new exercises. I love Karen Voight but this dvd was definately the worst I have yet to purchase of hers. All the other Karen Voight I own I absolutely love	0
I owned the VHS version of ''The Wild,Wild World'' but decided to get the DVD this winter.WELL..That was a great purchase !I understand people that could see the documentary of Jayne in Europe,as pretty cheaply made,BUT it is still Jayne,and if you love her (as I do),any film she was in (except The Girl can't help it,and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter) was done on the cheap,with ridiculously small budgets.'The Wild,Wild World' gives you the chance to see a candid Jayne in all kinds of very campy situations,and the best scenes are when Jayne pretends to be offended by the goings-on...It shows a Jayne Mansfield who was indeed a true-original,rather eccentric person in the anal-retentive American Fifties.I can't help comparing her to what Anna Nicole Smith has done with her 'career' as a media sensation,BUT Jayne was doing basically the same FIFTY years ago,which was understandbly much more shocking for the common-folks.When Jayne talks about her film roles,you wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself.I don't understand how she can be compared to Marilyn Monroe.MM was looking for privacy,more serious roles,spoke to journalists only if she absolutely had to,when Jayne was waking up her daughter in the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who needed something to write about.Jayne was not too picky about her roles,and the kind of attention she was getting,and it was her undoing.Sad,but she needed the money to keep up that image,all those children,dogs,and...husbands.NOW ,about ''The Labyrinth of Sex'': It is HYSTERICAL !! and a great choice to make the DVD a double-feature,just like the good-old days of the Drive-ins !When you get over the awful dubbing,the documentary is rather well made,naive to today's standards of course,but well-intentionned.Some viewers will just see crass-exploitation,but if you are into Campy,Kitsch movies,and you see Ed Wood Jr. as a genius...well you will love IT !.The movie trailers are very funny as well,and make you wish you could find them.So my conclusion is that DVD is an EXCELLENT purchase,a must-have for any serious Jayne Mansfield Fan !!	1

"These are not your typical teens. They love Broadway musicals and want a life of singing and dancing on stage. So here they are at ""Camp Ovation"" honing their skills. One of the teachers is a song songwriter. Because he is also a ""one hit wonder"" he's an angry alcoholic. The other characters (teenagers) are a ""fag hag"", a cross dresser, a chubby girl who has her mouth wired shut, a bleached blonde who thinks too highly of herself and her meek sidekick and a rare straight boy at the camp who lacks self-esteem. There is a three good scenes that made this film worth watching but in general mediocre movie. If you like musicals, you will proberly like this but might bore most people. "	0
"I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK!After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the ""robots attack people"" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL.I FEEL CHEATED!

I thought the first Ice Age was great.  This one is good, not great.  They really used scrat better this time than before, but the rest of the characters were.....not undeveloped, but it just didn't have as many hilarious situations.  Sid is as hilarious as ever, but manny and diego doen't do as much.  ITs a good, fun movie, but its not as good as the first one, rent it though, it does have some hilarious scenes	1
"The synopsis ...Sam and Jonah Baldwin, father and son, have lost the most important woman in their lives to cancer.  Seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk in every nook and cranny of Chicago, they move to Seattle.  Eighteen months later, Jonah can sense that his dad is still sad; and, in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self-help guru on Christmas Eve to wish for his father a new wife.  Annie Reed lives in Baltimore and is engaged to Walter.  Their relationship, while loving and comfortable, is entirely devoid of romantic sparks.  When Annie hears Jonah's soulful plea on the radio, it's as if her heart has been touched by ""magic"" and she is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to Sam and his son ... even if it means traveling across ""like 26 states"".The critique ...Sleepless in Seattle is a brilliantly simple film; that's what makes it so great.  To quote Nora Ephron, ""It isn't a movie about love, it's a movie about love in the movies.""  To emphasize this point, she incorporates various parallel references to ""An Affair to Remember"" throughout the film; but, Sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love (which, let's admit it, have been undeniably shaped by what we've seen on the silver screen).  The script is refreshingly candid, yet endearing and Nora Ephron's direction is impeccable.  Ross Malinger, cast as Jonah Baldwin, is the youngest and most notable talent in the film.  He does an excellent job of portraying THE quintessential eight-year-old; he's impulsive, moody and thinks he knows it all.  (I speak from experience here folks; I currently have a son that age.)  He and Tom Hanks come together flawlessly as father and son; so successfully in fact, that they would be utterly convincing off screen.  The chemistry between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks is equally amazing, which is no small achievement considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene.  The supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes Rosie O'Donnell, Bill Pullman, Rita Wilson, Rob Reiner, David Hyde Pierce, and a young Gaby Hoffmann.  Families with younger children will appreciate the film's integrity; there is very little foul language (""God damn it"" and "" ... it scared the shit out of me ..."" being the worst of it) and no ""sexual content"" to be wary of.  All around, this is a winning film.  One that I find myself watching over and over and over again.The DVD ...For a 10th Anniversary Edition, the special features are few and rather disappointing.  You've got your basic director commentary, a music video (""When I Fall in Love"" by Celine Dion & Clive Griffin), and a ""Love in the Movies"" Featurette.  This last piece is approximately 15 minutes long.  It features the director, producers,	actors and the hosts of Loveline: Drew Pinsky and Adam Carolla (why they are included, I don't know) talking about ""Love in the Movies.""  There are some interesting interview segments with an Empire State Building Historian and some very beautiful shots of the New York skyline before 9/11; but there's certainly nothing here to write home about.  By far, the most exciting feature is that you can choose your aspect ratio.  (And honestly, how exciting is that?)  This a DVD that you buy for the film alone.       "	1

"OK, I'm a SciFi fan.  I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end.  Just one problem, they forgot to write the end.  What happened?  Did they run out of money?  Did the writer write himself into a corner?  There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution.

"This live DVD was released as a companion to Randy Travis' ""Worship & Faith"" CD.  The concert was recorded on July 15, 2003 at Calvary Assmebly God Church in Orlando, Florida.  Here, Travis delivers many of the songs from the W&F album, plus ""Pray for the Fish"" and his country radio hit ""Three Wooden Crosses.""  Comments from Travis and from several fans are added in between songs.  Like its audio companion, this DVD contains a great mix of classic hymns, camp meeting songs and contemporary worship songs.  Some of the highlights include ""You Are Worthy of My Praise,"" ""Just a Closer Walk with Thee,"" ""We Fall Down"" and ""Open the Eyes of My Heart.""  Other noteworthy tracks include ""Shall We Gather at the River,"" ""Peace in the Valley,"" ""Above All"" and ""Love Lifted Me.""  Travis closes the show with ""Three Wooden Crosses,"" the first song recorded on a Christian music label to ever top the country music charts.  ""Worship & Faith"" is a great DVD for lovers of worship music, lovers of country music, as well as for any and every Randy Travis fan.  This is an excellent DVD"	1
"There are just some trilogy's that should not be made - and the Wild Things trilogy is one of them. This is not really a trilogy per se, since each of the films carries with it the same story, with the same twists. If you have seen the first, you have basically seen each of the sequels... except the sequels are both much worse. Take out the big name actors and make a direct-to-DVD release... and you have Wild Things: Diamonds In The Rough.I am sure you all know the story by now, but here is a brief synopsis... ""Things get steamy in Blue Bay, Florida, when Marie, a 17-year-old beauty, gets caught in a tangle of deceit and double-crossing after meeting the promiscuous Elena, the new girl at school. Will they get away with the perfect crime or is someone else behind this scheme?If you have seen one of the Wild Things films, you have seen them all. This film lacks the quality of the original - mainly because we already know the twists and turns to come. This disc does look great, and sounds pretty good, but the film takes away from the overall DVD presentation. If you want your Wild Things fix, the original version is the one to watch"	0
There's not much to say about the reputation of these movies.  There's also little to say about these DVDs, many of which are the high quality special edition collections.Just do the math.  This is no brainer for people who don't own any of these DVDs.  Even if you only want 8 of them (less than half!), that's about $20.00 a movie (at Amazon's present sales price) and since many of these movies are special editions, that's still a steal!This is a solid place to start your DVD collection.  Not everyone will enjoy all these movies (after all, they range from westerns to romantic pieces to musicals), but at this price even giving half of them away still allows you a tremendous savings.One note:  the version of Amadeus here is the reissue and the longer, director's cut of the movie that was not originally released.  Some (including myself) prefer the tighter original release (which can still be gotten at Amazon but sadly has no commentary and requires you to flip the disc in the middle of the movie!)	1
In this film made in UK and Luxembourg, Madeline Stowe stars as Senga. Senga and her daughter Nat are driving at midnight after visiting Nat's father. They bicker the whole trip and it just increases when they stop for a break at a rest stop. Nat runs away with a mysterious girl who tries and recruits her into a mysterious cult. And we are left with a nerve wracked mother doing all she hectically can to retrieve her daughter.Both the daughter and mother eventually learn that this cult kills people for their blood. Why they do so is never explained. And even at this point when Senga is trying to rescue Nat, she still acts like a brat. The last third of the movie seems to just generate more confusion. And becomes unbelievable and my main reason for the rating I assigned.That good part of the movie has to be attributed to the direction, not the wirtting. The movie is dark and suspenseful. Though you do not know what really is transpiring in this movie, it does keep you on the edge of the seat as Senga tries to rescue her daughter	0
eddie murphy is a comical guy, but is he really the right guy to play in something as stupid as this? Of course, who is the right guy for it?

Not what I expected when renting this movie. As others have said Clarissa came off too pure and innocent.  Futhermore, I don't understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world?  Everyone knows what Lovelace has done..there are numerous accounts. Yet she goes with him anyway?  Blah.  The acting was OK. The costumes were excellent(I love period movies) but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged.  And as another put it, I was very glad when Clarissa kicked the bucket.I read a lot of historical fiction, classic novels and love period movies, but there was no liking this one. It just couldnt be done	0
Firstly I must say how much I dislike Jennifer Lopez so attempting to watch this movie has been a struggle since it was first released however I decided to brave it out for the sake of Ralph Fiennes.  Lopez plays a maid who falls for a guy who has loads of money (Fiennes, who is miscast, really) He thinks she is a guest in the hotel, she plays along. So she lies about herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed, it comes to a ridiculous ending.  There's not much else to say to this cinderella movie, except maybe that it's not funny. Lopez isn't a great actress, she and Fienness have about as much chemistry as a toothbrush in a toiletbowl	0
This was a hugely disappointing film. I did not see it on stage nor do I want to if it is ever resurrected. It trivializes illness, death, God, heaven, range of human emotion and love in all forms. I have grown up in a post-AIDS world and can see so many problems far worse than AIDS.I am tired of listening to actors drone on in selfish pursuits. While America focuses on such banal subject matter, larger more urgent problems are clearly ignored by a society that thinks it has the luxury of still trying to come to grips with sexuality	0
"Another film in the never-ending series of ""Giant Animated Snake Eats People"" films that have been plaguing us for almost a decade.  The creators of a maximum-security prison in the Antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb the ten-million-plus slumber of 80-foot hungry reptile.There's nothing more to this film than that.  ""Boa"" (also known as ""New Alcatraz"") actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness, which I don't think was a smart idea.  The technical team - photography, production design-set decoration, etc. - create a fairly effective, chilling atmosphere, but everything else about ""Boa"" is strictly routine.Dean Cain does a job I would describe as tolerable, although Elizabeth Lackey is just that - lacking - as his wife, and the supporting cast (Mark Sheppard, Grand L. Bush, Craig Wasson) is just a touch more professional.The film-makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we can't see just how fake it looks.I don't really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with; other, similar titles include ""Python"" 1 and 2, ""Anaconda"" (the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997) and ""Anaconda: Search for the Blood Orchid"", and the inevitable ""Boa Vs.

This was a very annoying and boring flick thats barely watchable and throughout the film I kept looking at my watch, the film is not a historical drama nor is it an autobiographical film about William Shakespreare infact it is a romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama. My girlfriend insisted that we watch this film together but I wasn't in the mood she forced me to watch this, the film was about a struggling young writer Shakespeare played by Joseph Fiennes who falls in love with Lady Viola played by Gwyneth Paltro who also happens to inspire his famous play Romeo and Juliet, this film also won a couple of oscars including Gwyny for best actress but I felt like the film was just not that funny because all the characters seemed to talk in an old English style thats hard to understand. Overall the film was just O.K. I think that some of the sets and costumes were fantastic and Judi Dench was great as Queen Elizabeth but I never want to watch this film again, if your a Shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like this film more than I did.	0
It's my first semester teaching a general-student Jazz History course, and I wanted something beyond the textbook to get the students involved.  I bought this video as a &quot;best-of-all-options&quot; choice, and was  bowled over by it's thoroughness and attention to detail.  Everything we'd  discussed about Armstrong during class was there on the tape, reinforcing  my lectures and giving the kids a nice opportunity to both hear AND see the  legendary Louis.  For pure entertainment alone it was worthwhile, but for  instructional purposes I'd consider it a necessity for any future jazz  classes I'd teach.  I paid $16 bucks for it, but having seen it I think  I'd've paid fifty!  (Shh!  Don't tell Amazon!	1
"Die hard fans of writer-director David Cronenberg may find funny dialogue and grotesquely engrossing scenes in this sci-fi horror tale. That accounts for so many 5 star ratings by other reviewers. That was not my reaction to this film.  It was slow, uninteresting and the ending was a disappointment. I give it only 2 stars.The characters stumble through a virtual role playing game and pretend they are... gamers. Duh. Cronenberg needs more than ideas for his next film, he needs a good script and actors who are more suited for their roles.  William Defoe is completely miscast as a gas station attendant. Jennifer Jason Leigh's wardrobe looks like retro-1980's. Jude Law does well except for a couple of unexplained accent changes. Beware of the tag line that says eXistenZ ""makes the Matrix look like child's play."" This film is no where near the caliber of the Matrix. If you are not a Cronenberg fan, I recommend that you pass on this dull film"	0
No No No!!! DVD technology is for quality image and  movie  collectors. This time Artisan did not pay respect. I think it's the worst DVD in my collection. Bad transfer, full frame and etc	0
"I was surprised that so many people childishly attacked the person who gave this movie one-star. Someone even accused them of not being young at heart. Well, I don't like this film, and I'm young at heart; I'm just not immature, so try not to confuse the two. Some of you need to check your spelling before accusing someone else of bad writing. Having said that, on to the film: Julie and friends are simply DYING to be included in the in-crowd their first year of high school, so on the night Julie has a sleepover, they make a deal with some rival girls to go on a ""scavenger"" hunt, which is basically one huge dare game. The group that fulfills the dares first get to be popular by... (drumroll, please) sitting at The Popular Lunch Spot. That is, a picnic bench by the school fountain. That's right; popularity is not guaranteed by WHO you sit with, but WHERE you sit. Pick the right spot, and you may just magically become Queen Bee for the rest of the year. In case you couldn't tell by my sarcasm, the shallow impracticality of this film truly bugs me at times. We all know the whole popularity thing is practically a tradition for teen chick-flicks, but this film tended to go over the top with a lot of it. Granted, a lot of the exaggerated silliness worked for the film; in fact, the movie's beginning surprised me with many clever and well-written clips. However, there is such a thing as going too far. The movie becomes absolutely dedicated to making teen girls look like sassy but fashionably ingenuis bimbos and making teen boys look like...well, the dumbest, scruffiest beings that ever stumbled on the planet. Not that all the boys are like this, mind you; there are a few of the god-like types that the girls practically kill themselves for. It got worse, however, when the film attempted to fit in a few serious scenes. If the movie had stuck to pure sarcastic silliness the whole time, it might've worked. Instead,the few attempts to be serious usually fell flat on their faces because the seriousness went in the wrong direction. For example, there was the nauseating scene where poor beaten Julie nearly gives up her scavenger hunt and one of her friends says, ""Julie, I KNOW you can do this; I believe in you"" in a tone which implies that they're talking about a major life crisis instead of a juvenile daredevil game. The worst ""serious"" scene, however, is when Julie attempts to get into a dance (therefore fulfilling the final dare) and the ticket seller won't let her in because she doesn't have a ticket. Suddenly inspired, Julie gives the ticket seller a sickening ""I know who you are"" speech, telling her that she knows she was a nerd her whole high school life and that now, because of her former nerdiness, she's become a poor ticket seller. Julie ends her speech by wailing, ""I can see myself being you in four years if I don't go to this dance!""  The ticket seller leaps to her feet but, instead of punching Julie, suddenly breaks into a smile and says, ""Go ahead and go in!"" Um, WHAT?? Whatever happened to the girls finding out that popularity isn't everything after all and actually getting lives and acting like humans? (Not to mention that nice sock in the mouth I was hoping Julie would get). Is this what we want to teach our kids, that being dedicated to work makes them nerds and that partying all the time will get them somewhere in life? I personally think the ""nerds"" are far better off than the girls who lose their virginity on the first date and party all year rather than learn anything. It was this scene and this message that seriously lowered the film in my opinion. I'm not sure why the filmmakers decided to end the film with this childish message. Maybe they did it on a dare because the popular filmmakers finally offered them a cool lunch spot in exchange. I recommend ""Never been Kissed"" and ""Mean Girls"" far more than this film; they have good moral lessons as well as intelligent humor. Oh, before I finish, here's one more valuable lesson from this film: Girls, if you want to win a guy who's never noticed you, all you have to do is strike a cool pose, hop on a skateboard, and ride it directly in front of his car. (Don't forget to wear an expensive dress and look flawless while you're at it). Do this, and he will be so in love with you that he won't even care if you tell him that you did something freakish like stealing his underwear. The things we learn from movies, huh?                                                 "	0
I saw a glimpse of this movie earlier on HBO and was interested enough to purchase the DVD.  Too bad I didn't watch the movie first when it was free!  James Earl Jone's acting abilities were wasted on this movie, and I won't comment on the others.I'm glad that our armed forces are not as inept as portrayedin this film.  Sorry I can't be more complimentary, but.....	0
This is a great work out!  You can really work up a sweat and it's low impact on the knees	1
If you're looking to hear Robert Johnson's songs, you should probably buy one of the awesome collections availible.  As this legend and musical genius has now been dead for 65 years, I'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for besides other people covering his songs, and talk about his life... that's all we have now.  And of course the covers do not outdo him; that would be impossible.  But there is some very thoughtful discussion on the life of Robert Johnson and the world he lived in.  The discussion with a former classmate is touching, and the covers of his songs by those who knew him (Robert Lockwood Jr., Honeyboy Edwards)and by some of the new delta-blues talent such as Guy Davis, Roy Rogers and especially Alvin Youngblood Heart blew me away.  Gov't Mule and Sonny Landreth do some awesome electric renditions of his work.  The major let downs are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock n' roll hall of fame gathering, and also Bob Weir's performance, which is just plain bad.  All in all, it is a good film, and it's nice to actually be able to watch people play his music, as we will never be able to see the real thing	1
"I grew up watching Sesame Street and truly love the Muppets. However, I have to say this video was not what I expected. There were some great vintage clips, but not enough muppets/monsters for me. This video seemed hastily thrown together with bad editing. I would recommend you pass on this one and get ""123 Count With Me"" instead."	0
"One of the best-directed films of 2006, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is built for multiple viewings and perhaps for cult audiences.  And even though ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" may require multiple viewings just to catch all of the rapid-fire dialogue, or to untangle the plot, one of the best reasons for multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill:  It's a Class-A tutorial for amateur filmmakers or simply armchair film-buffs who will appreciate the highwire juggling act that Shane Black pulls off here, with ""KKBB""'s sudden shifts of tone from slapstick to dead-serious drama to gallows-comedy.If that seems like an easy feat, well... Remember ""1941""?  Not even Spielberg got it right.  But Shane Black nails it here -- and it's his directorial debut.Downey & Kilmer are also at the top of their game here, but it's Michelle Monaghan who impresses with a flat-out great performance that keeps up with the veterans.""Sui Generis"" (one-of-a-kind) is the phrase that best describes ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"" although it's remarkably mainstream at times.  It's a showcase of talents for everyone involved, and when the bullets aren't flying, there's even a romantic comedy here & social commentary to boot.  I can't think of any other film quite like it -- and that's just how the Warner Brothers tradition seems to work (at its best)."	1
The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film	0
This movie is full of memorable scenes, although it's probably been more than a decade since I last saw it.  It's suspenseful without being gory...the most memorable scene is one that is absolutely chilling without ever showing a drop of blood. And even though I'd read the book and knew the outcome I was on the edge of my seat right to the finish	1
"Don't buy the directors cut.Badder Santa is absolutely hysterical.  For some strange reason the director decided to make a ""director's cut"" that is a neutered version of ""badder santa"".I bought it yesterday when it came out and the internal dialogue from Billy Bob in the first scene was missing.  The celebration in the bar after the first mall ""heist"", where Billy Bob proclaims he's giving up drinking, was missing.  The next scene where Billy Bob was stealing drinks from the bar on the beach and fights with the bartender was missing.That was enough for me.  I immediately shut it off and Best Buy agreed to let me swap it for ""Badder Santa"" due to the false impression of a ""longer and fuller"" cut than it's predecessor, as is the industry standard.  I was duped.  Please buy ""Badder Santa"" instead.  This is a watered down/Walmart version of a classic, not an extended cut"	0
"""Modigliani"" (2004) is a self-indulgent, pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist. Writer-director Mick Davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work. Ironically, the viewer has a better understanding of Pablo Picasso than Amedeo Modigliani. Despite his boundless enthusiasm, Andy Garcia is simply too old for the title role. An irritating fiasco that deserved its straight-to-video fate"	0

Funny thing to mention here is that the stated region block (region 1) isn't really present. I took the shot to order this and unlock my DVD player if I had to (I live in Amsterdam, region 2) but I didn't have to!! This DVD is region free! Thanks Amazon, but in future it would be nice to provide correct region-information. I bet that a lot European (and perhaps Australian, Russian and so on) customers cancel their order because of the region code not corresponding with their country region.Regard	1
I found this movie delightful--from the storyline, directing and photography to the actors! I especially loved the performances of Timothy Bottoms and Chloris Leachman!  It's an enlightening movie that makes an important point: sometimes what we think we want is not really what we want at all	1
This is great Holloween movie to watch to get you in the spirit! I watch it numerous times every year right before Holloween with my little sister. Its a great Movie!!!!!!!	1
this movie is nothing special, it's not super awesome but it's still good.  i'm the triple shot gun thing is awesome and it's fairly gory.  if you're into dead alive, cannibal holocaust, the return of the living dead movies, and just cheap funny/gory zombie movies i recomend this movie	1

"After being into the ""techno"" scene since my first party in 1993, this is one of the best videos I have seen describing the DJ feelings. You really get a feel for how a DJ thinks. If you at all interested in the DJ lifestyle or are interested in DJing this is a must have. It have great insights in the minds of some of the best DJs around. Plus Nigel Richards does a great job with the ""How to DJ"" part. Not only is this for the ""newbies"" but for those who have been around a bit. Plus he makes learning fun with his comments and body mannerisms. WOW that sounded like an infomercial"	1
Well, almost. The seats were good and I drank straight out of the bottle. The DVD wasn't what I thought I had purchased but I'm not at all unhappy about getting it. Very, very, very good quality audio/video and I don't mind watching it often	1
"Patton Oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance. It's because of Comedy Central mangling the DVD version.The show was originally broadcast on Comedy Central, and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one-hour time slot with commercials. The DVD has the original show, and then in the bonus section, it has ""deleted scenes,"" which are the parts of the full-length concert that were cut for time. So, you can watch the time-edited show, or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out. But what you can't do, and what I have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do, is see the original full-length show in its entirety.So, cheers for Patton, boos for CC. I won't be buying the DVD and that's why."	0
"Barbershop is a rare event in African-American filmmaking. It's one of the few that actually tells a fairly accurate story of what life is like for African-Americans. I love the fact that the movie showed how diverse the African-American community is; we see black people from different walks of life and different lifestyles shown onscreen. I really liked this movie. We definitely need more films like thisCalvin is the owner of a Chicago Barbershop passed on to him by his late father. Mired in debt from the shop and his crazy business schemes, Calvin is desperate to start something of his own and feels that the barbershop is a hindrance on his life. It's not until he sells the barbershop to a loan shark that he realizes the value of the shop to the community and sees a role for himself in the neighborhood. There are a dozen other stories that link to this main one and they're all easy to follow. One follows a stolen ATM machine, one follows the quest for love of an African immigrant, another follows a female barber and her cheating boyfriend, another follows a guy desperate for a haircut to go to a job interview, and yet another follows a white barber's quest for acceptance by the black barbers he works with. In a way, this film reminded me of those great ensemble movies like Pulp Fiction that follow many characters and their stories. Each of the stories lead up to the ending where Calvin saves the barbershop.Director Tim Story does a great job of capturing life in Chicago and the informal environment of the barbershop. I felt the spirit of the Windy City and the informal environment of the barbershop. Watching the conversations in the movie reminded me of the barbershop in Harlem my father used to take me to when I was a boy. It also reminded me of the charged atmosphere of the old barbershop I used to go to get my flat-top trimmed (Both are closed now.) :( There are a ton of great performances in this movie; I'm probably going to miss mentioning a few people. Ice Cube is great as Calvin. I liked his performance here. Michael Ealy stands out in his role as an ex-con trying to turn his life around by becoming a barber. Ealy makes you feel his characters' desperation. Cedric the Entertainer makes a breakthrough performance as an old barber. He's funny and poignant. Sean Nelson is great as an educated man who works as a barber while going to college. Anthony Anderson and Larenz Tate are hilarious as two bumbling thieves who steal an ATM with no money in it. Watching them try to open will make you laugh. Keith David is creepy as the loan shark. Then again, Keith David is always good in anything he does. I'd pay money to watch him and Sam Jackson read listings in the yellow pages.I don't know why Movie Critics and the Rev. Jesse Jackson denounced Barbershop, it's one of the best movies ever made about African-American life. Looking at the box office of Barbershop and Diary of a Mad Black Woman, African-Americans actually WANT more films like this. As a black moviegoer I want different black films that allow the world to see the whole community, not just one small part of it. I for one and tired of the ""Hood"" movies like Never Die Alone, and Critically acclaimed movies like Monster's Ball and Hustle & Flow that depict black life as something negative. (Thankfully, it seems the rest of the black community is tired of these types of movies too, the box office and DVD sales for them is declining while the box office for movies like Barbershop and Diary of a Mad Black woman are going up.) End of rant, back to the review.A Shawn James essential Five Star video. You must buy this movie. Get some friends together put the DVD in the machine, Pull up a chair and have a seat in front of the TV and hang out at the Barbershop. "	1

2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much happier than when I came in.This film is full of quick one-liners that deserve a laugh. The special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open. I have heard and read that people didn't appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races, but overall, I think the balance works well. Even thinking of the plot that we are left with, I really can't see another time when a race would even be appropriate.And as for people saying that this film is worse than the original, I would have to disagree...Why? Frankly, I have always been a firm believer than Vin Diesel is entirely overrated as an actor. (I mean, c'mon - Have you seen the Pacifier?) He's nothing more than a meat head who, while able to do pretty good fight scenes, should leave the dialogue to someone else. Yes, this film is for the younger crowd, and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place (take the boat jumping as an example), but there is no saying that an older person wouldn't enjoy it as well...The only thing that I will say is that you really shouldn't go into this film expecting an Oscar worthy performance, or else you will be disappointed. If you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is, however, you will thoroughly enjoy yourself	1
Argento is an incarnation of everything that film is and everything that it could have been as conceived by Lumiere. After Hitchcock and Ray, Leone and Fuller, Argento is the last true auteur to make genre films. Visually, a film like Profondo Rosso calls upon the ghosts of the cinema because everything that is filmed, objects and people alike, take on the same importance and that this inevitably leads to the resolution of the mystery which is at the center of the film. Argento can only film something as itself and this is why he is an extraordinary filmmaker. Cinema is not an answer but a question and Argento is the answer to Eisenstein's theory of film as violence, violence not only in the images themselves but in the great void that awaits them. A murder, a painting, a mother, a son, a mirror, all of these things will lead to a beautiful composition of images in which the mystery of seeing, the mystery of cinema, the questions, are resolved.	1
Together with 'Odyssey Into the Minds Eye', two of my favorite DVDs in my collection.  They may be watched forever because the constant change of images and inventions cannot be retained by memory. Enormous visual pleasure with appropriate soothing sound track.  There is something healing in this flow of beautiful worlds and mind conceptions	1
Good subject, the workings of a devious female mind.  A complicated love triangle.  Superb acting	1
My sister and I loved this show growing up (The Huxtables reminded us of our extended family!) The episode where Stevie Wonder came on was our favorite and one of the best episodes (in my opinion).  ..I do question why in Amazon's list of actors at the top of the page (for the Season 2 set)...Joseph C. Philips is the only one listed.  Although he was a guest at one point he did not become a regular till much later.  Regardless, this is a great collection and a must for Cosby fans. 	1
"What an incredible waste of acting talent ""There Was a Crooked Man"" turned out to be.  Director Joseph Mankiewicz celebrated for classics such as ""All About Eve"" and ""The Barefoot Contessa"" should be embarrassed by this bomb.Kirk Douglas plays Paris Pittman Jr. a charming, persuasive prisoner incarcerated in Territorial prison for ten years for an armed robbery that netted him $500,000.  He hid the loot prior to his capture.  It's presence is common knowledge among the inmates giving him celebrity status.  Newly appointed warden Woodrow Lopeman played by Henry Fonda is trying to use Douglas' influence to coax the inmates help him initiate prison reform.Under the guise of playing along with Fonda, Douglas secretly plots his escape to be reunited with his ill gotten cash.With an excellent cast including Hume Cronyn, Burgess Meredith and Lee Grant, I expected a whole lot more than this disappointing flick delivered"	0
Exactly what I thought I was purchasing. Shipped quickly. Definately would recommend this seller	1
I just saw this move for the first time in wide screen and it is a much different experience I must say. I think I have figured it out. In some other reviews I think Batricia Birch should have just stayed with the songs and the numbers. I think they should have got another director to get the rest of the movie off the ground. It is somewhat of a good story. I can see why it would be reversed (a guy trying to get the girl, instead of the other way around). You see Eugine in the beginning of the movie stumbling out of the bus. Well if he were a senior in the first one then why is he in the second one???? Also Frenchie is not with the Pink Ladies at all. You see her by herself or just briefly with the other pink ladies in school. I think the chemistry between Stephanie and Michael were worked well together. The songs were written by the same people that wrote the songs for the first movie. So really the bottom line is that they should have gotten a different director altogether. I know I know it is not the first one. But sequels are usually not, but they usually have connections to the first. Grease 2 tried to accomplish with Frenchie and the Tbirds, Pink ladies and all. I am glad they were able to have Eve Arden, Sid Ceaser, plus other great actors of the 50s and 60s like Tab Hunter. Is this movie cheesy???? Yes Is it done in less than expected direction???? Yes. Does it have good songs??  Yes (Cool Rider, Reproduction, We'll Always be Together, Girl for all Seasons/Turn Back, and Back to School). The song skits themselves are good and with the same flavor of the first one. After all Kiddies, Patricia Birch did do the choreography for both. So, in closing, this movie made it to my DVD collection if for that reason alone. If Grease 2 is going to stink then let it reek. If it has its moments of good cute fun then let it have that. I think if you loved the first Grease then I think you should at least give this one a try.     	1
I was just surfing the shelves at Borders today when I stumbled over Queen Kelly on DVD!  I couldn't believe it. I have just been getting interested in silent films (I'm 18) and of course I'm a Gloria Swanson fan (who isn't?), having seen her brilliant performance in Sunset Blvd. Anyway, I had always heard rumors about Queen Kelly - the incomplete, forgotten masterpiece. I had to pay a whopping [money] for this DVD, but it is definitely a piece of art and worth every penny.    First of all, this film is old. You can hear it creak and moan at times and the orchestra soundtrack has not aged well - let's just say the music is annoyingly intense. But the age of the film just makes it more haunting to watch. The story takes place in the 20s, but you could almost believe it was hundreds of years ago.    Now I want to concentrate on the story and the performances. Gloria Swanson's performance in Queen Kelly has to be one of her best - she was every bit as good in this film as in Sunset Blvd. We can easily see why she was such a huge silent star - her emotions and beauty carry the film just as much as the fascinating story.     This was really melodrama at its best. People tend to forget, I think, that melodrama can be an art form, stressing wistful idealism and instead of cynical realism!  The main event here is the story - wow! It's tragic that the film (and the story) were never finished. But who knows? It's just begging for a megabucks remake with Nicole Kidman. Now that the musicals are back, maybe silents will be next	1
Note that in my previous review, in which I commented on the dreadful DVD  transfer, I was only referring to the &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; DVD.  The Father Goose DVD is not that bad	0
I totally love this DVD! They really show how to do grooves, not just some moves that you can only do to a specific music video. These are grooves you can make  your own and go and dance any where with. That what I think makes this DVD series totally different from the rest. The moves are current and fun and the host and dancers are excellent dancers and also fun to watch. It goes slow enough and they turn around backwards to show you how to do it. LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! I am hooked on the Groovaloos	1
"I saw all the revies for this movie and was expecting a dark enjoyable tale about a libtertine.  I was strongly mistaken.  Johnny Depp is a great actor with great abilites, but this is the worst movie of his I have ever seen.  Even his ""cheesy"" movies were better than this.  The rated R rating is light.  I couldn't believe how pornographic it was.  Even in Quills, it wasn't as raunchy as this.  Don't waste your money or your time with this one"	0
I didn't switch of after 3 minutes because I thought the film was trying to be deliberately bad as a precursor for the better bits to come.  I switched off after 7	0
It is so strange for a famous actor like Stallone to play as bad as Stowe; may be it is competition between them to make you exhausted of watching this film. This boring story is about a bodyguard, which has been repeated in different films many times. The worst is the director who could not manage the film. After 15 minutes it made me sleep. I regret for the money that I paid for the DVD	0
I have been waiting for this DVD to come out for a very long time!  It is a hilarious movie based on a true story about the creation of the Bradley war tank.  It shows how the promotion system in the military used to push for new war products to be used, even if they were not acceptable for use, and the struggle of one man to do the right thing.  You will not stop laughing while watching this movie! 	1
These plays were okay, I'm glad I rented them before buying them.  The props and things were very nice, the actors didn't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre ( definitely no Tyler Perry quality on that note) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out.  I thought Alexander O'Neal sang in one of them but he didn't	0
This DVD of the Wiggles is my 21/2 year old grandsons favorite.  He watches it every day and never tires of it.  I enjoy watching it with him.  The Wiggles are great entertainment for people of all ages.  I don't think you can go wrong with The Wiggles	1
WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THE FRIENDS SERIES...5 DOWN, 5 TO GO!The 5th Season of Friends is the season where: *Monica and Chandler start their relationship*Ross gets married...AGAIN to RACHEL out of being very very drunk!*They pass the 100th episodeWhenever I watch Season Five all I can really say is that it is easily watchable and is quite good, but it isnt my favourite season. For some reason I notice the episodes are kind of all over the place and its not like it used to be. Dont get me wrong I still  love the show and this Season is good, but this one isn't vital. I personally only bought this season for that episode where Monica has a turkey on her head with the big glasses and hat and then dances! I know! Stupid! Lol but its classic!This season Box set isnt desperately needed in your collection, unless you want to see Monica and Chandler start their relationship and hide it with Joey covering for them constantly (The One With Ross's Sandwich is great when Joey covers for Monica and Chandler!)The top 5 Episodes are very easy to pick for this particular season. My Personal Top 5 Episodes Are:The One With All The KissingThe One Hundredth (Has to be here! The 100th!)The One with the Thanksgiving FlashbacksThe One Where Everybody Finds Out (BEST HERE!!!!)The One Where Rachel SmokesI didnt care much for the Season Finale, I mean, identical hand twin?? Not very funny. Very time wasting!. The only really good thing in the final is The Very Last Scene!!!Overall, not a stellar season, Not as good as Season 3 or 4 but definitley up there somewhere. Not desperatley needed in your collection, IF ONLY COLLECTING A FEW. Contains some very good episodes. The One Where Everybody Finds Out is a highlight! Check that out	1
"This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto ""Semper Eadem"", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history"	0
Batman Begins is soooo much better than this or any other of the batman movies. Nicholson SUCKED as the Joker. Joker is a comedian who had an accident trying to pull a robbery to help his pregnant wife. HE IS NOT A GANGSTER OR THE ONE WHO KILLED BATMAN'S PARENTS!!!! HE IS A PSYCHO AND BATMAN'S NEMESIS!!! YOU CAN'T KILL HIM OFF!!! HOW STUPID IS THAT?!!! Who came up with that one. Keaton is a sissy, Christian Bale could beat him down!!! Keaton DID NOT have the physical prescence to play Batman. All in all, a joke of a comic movie..But it is better than Daredevil!!!!:-	0
"It has been a long time since I read the novel upon which this book is based, but I do clearly remember it making sense.  This movie doesn't even make sense (to quote a chicken I know).  Marlon Brando somnambulizes his way through the film and, instead of coming off as sinister, menacing, and dominating, he makes Dr. Moreau into a joke.  Val Kilmer's portrayal is vacuous and silly.  Is the character supposed to be under the influence?  I guess he wanted it portrayed that way.  The script?  Is there one?  Moreau talks about having almost reached his goal.  Where?  His one ""son"" and his ""daughter"" do have some fine traits, but both are also pretty ineffectual.Several reviews have mentioned the special effects.  I actually saw very few special effects.  The rat-people on the boat were creepy and well-done, and some of the characters did make some superhuman moves, but mostly I saw people in very elaborate, well-done costumes, using well-distorted voices.The central character, played by David Thewlis, should have been the focus of the movie, as he is the narrator.  He kept getting lost in the shuffle, and I kept waiting for him to see things that I saw, and to ask the questions that I would have asked.  I like him as an actor, but this is certainly not a memorably good performance.  It is somewhat ironic that he is the witness to animal-human hybrid horror here, but is the werewolf in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.""The film does create a sense of the nightmare.  Several of the characters do show glimpses of depth and genuineness, most notably Ron Perlman's preacher, but then he's well-practiced, from his ""Beauty and the Beast"" television series.  That was what (barely) earned this film its second star.  Let's vote them all off the island, and start over.  Robert Duvall as Moreau?  Replace Kilmer with Matt Damon?  Casey Affleck replacing David Thewlis"	0
This entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you wouldn't miss anything and might even enjoy it. Unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and I couldn't wait for it to end.  I saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was. At least a quarter of them walked out before the end. It's that bad. It's a shame, I love a good suspense/horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted	0
I have watched this movie along with many other Jet Li films. To be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection. I was so caught up in the title that I really was expecting much more from the film. But I was very disappointed to say the least. The movie takes place in the early eighties. When Gangs dressed in leather with chains, carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally. This was not the type of movie that I was expecting Jet Li to be in. If you want some real action packed Jet Li pick up the Contract Killer which will give you alot more for your money TRUST ME you want be disappointed	0
I loved this show and have been waiting for it to come out on something so I could watch the episodes again...I can't wait for season two to come out. If you were a fan of this show, you have to get it..	1
"My impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor. It's all style, no substance. I got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks, long slow camara pans across Stephen Dorff's very trendy and stylish haircut, and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with. Despite the very art-house feel of it, the story is lost, the viewer is never quite sure if the ""philosophy"" of the main character is meant to be taken seriously, and the style is nothing we haven't seen done better other places.All in all, I found it pretty vapid, painfully slow, and incredibly frustrating, because there is a good movie in here SOMEWHERE, if only the script had gone to someone else to make.On a side note, Toby Maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser, which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went"	0
What is it with the British film scene and its distinctly gritty style. It seems that if we're not producing trashy Ealing comedies, it's a shocking reality drama with the likes of Ray Winstone in it? Well Ray Winstone isn't in this one, but he could well be as the Rat Catcher is another one of those 'you either enjoy challenging films or you don't' pieces.I personally love them, I guess I must be a miserable bugger! Of course this film investigates the reality of the underclass, dysfunctional life lived in a rough and grimey housing estate.  But it is unique (well probably not unique) in that it is told pretty much entirely from the view of the 12 year old boy, played by William Eadie, who is struggling to make some sense of what is going on around him.  We learn that no matter what environment children grow up in, they always seem to hold true and remain untainted somehow.  Without wishing to give too much away, it is the final brief scene of this film which has stayed in my mind ever since I watched it in 2000. Worth the wait if you like being deeply moved by simple things	1
"""When was the last time you actually bought a ticket to see a movie, you actually paid your own money to see it?""""Last night, Pasedena. The Bicycle Thief.""""It's an art movie. It doesn't count. We're talking about movie movies.""Robert Altman is one of my favorite directors, mainly for the way he finds insight in the most inane actions or phrases. This short exchange has many layers when taken out of context and many more when taken in context. With this dialog, The Player reveals exactly why Hollywood movies don't make the money they should. Not because they don't make quality films, but because when a good movie does make money, it doesn't count because it's not a ""movie movie."" If he stopped to really listen to what was being said, he would've seen that art films have a great drawing power and actually don't cost much to make. But people still wonder why the modern film industry is suffering.Wait, there's more. The people in the room don't know it, but producer Griffin Mill, in a fit of paranoia, killed an unemployed screenwriter outside the theater that night. He was being stalked by a writer, but he blamed (and murdered) the wrong one. Now he's still being stalked, still in danger of losing his job, and the cops suspect him of murder. Not a good week for Mister Mill.As the conversation presses on, Mill's potential replacement passes around a newspaper, telling people to read random headlines to be made into scripts. Mill spots the story on his murder which we're already watching play out in a movie.Yes, it's that type of movie, the self-referential Hollywood movie about Hollywood movies that keeps teasing itself for the viewers' enjoyment. We've seen it about a thousand times before (or since): Get Shorty, Adaptation, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, even certain elements of 8 1/2. There's really nothing too special about it, but this one has much more subtlety and is much more believable. Pay close attention to the ending scene, and think about what words they're using opposed to what they're really saying.There's really only one word for a film like this: ""Clever!"	1
Whether you're Greek - or whatever - just about anyone can relate to Toula's life. After having deemed herself hopeless for thirty-odd years, then finally meeting the man of her dreams, Toula's real obstacle is surving her family! While his parents are quiet and typical Americans, Toula's clan embraces their roots -- telling strangers the intimate details of their medical histories, roasting a lamb in the front yard, Gramma in the old-country babushka. You'll laugh til you cry, 'cause chances are, you know someone exactly like each of Toula's relatives..	1
Very good film, hard hitting, emotional and I'm sure some aspects really do happen (although I have yet to witness much of it since I've been in LA	1
I am a dancer. I found the choreography in this movie beautiful, brillient and different. The emotion in it really touched me, and I had actually fallen out of dancing because of many different reasons and this movie really did bring me back to my love of dance. It's very rare to find dance movie that will offer quite as much as this movie did. Not to mention I absolutly adore George De La Pena. Awsome dancer and he was my favorite character in the movie. I love the fact that every character has something they are working through, no one is exactly perfect. To me, although the acting may not be what every one would call oscar quality, to me, it shows a glimps in to life. How pent up emotions can lead to frustrations that are some times difficult to get through. This movie, to me is well worth the watch. Sorry for the ramble.	1

Excellent little known movie with Viggo Mortensen as an F.B.I.agent under deep cover to infiltrate Japenese Mob. Greatperformances by all {Michael Nouri, a little over the top}great action and sentimentality when Viggos character is tornbetween man who treats him like a son and duty as an agent afterF.B.I makes deal with mobster Nouri to make a hit on the Yakuza	1
"The story is a rather strange mixture of innocence and evil with Mitchum in one of his nastiest roles. It's almost like he was rehearsing for his nastiest role in CAPE FEAR. He meets his match in Lillian Gish's character who stands up to him and is just as courageous and savvy as she is ""sweet"". In fact, the performances were great all around in this atmospheric film. Charles Laughton, in his only stint at directing, does an excellent job but I think he might have done more with the climax because it did seem that it could have been a little better and have more tension. A very good example of film noir"	1
There are not many movies I have switched off after the first 30 minutes, but this is one of them, and I recommend you rent this one first before you buy or else you might have a nasty surprise	0
An absolute must have for all parents, families and professionals!  As a speech &amp; language pathologist, I have worked with special needs children for 17 years, and finally I have viewed a high quality product for children diagnosed with Down Syndrome.  Informative, comprehensive and heart warming are just a few words to describe this excellent DVD.  I would highly recommend it for not only families, but for ALL professionals working with this population.  In fact, I believe it should be part of the training and curriculum for all disciplines intending to serve these wonderful children.  Thanks for a great product	1
It's as good if not better than Volume 1 of Cartoons That Time Forgot. The episodes are a bit more wierd in this volume. Hope there will be a Volume 3 coming out soon	1
With a very good scenario and a fantastic Kris Kristofferson the film is slow, over male attitude, and finally  poorly made and boring	0

VHS - I have watched this over and over and LOVED every minute of it so much so I have now ordered the DVD I only wished the film could have lasted longer. I never worry about what other people think I prefer to make my own mind up and entirely disagree with the negative comments and will not let others spoil my enjoyment of the film whatsoever.  Make up your own mind and don't let others put you off!  I have all Jane Austen's BBC series but this is my FAVOURITE.Angie London Englan	1
"Bob Clark's 1974 chiller classic, which went on to inspire many elements of ""Halloween"" and ""When a Stranger Calls"", is definitely one of the better, if not best, horror films out there. Period. Not high on blood, but very high on suspense, dread, atmosphere, and out-of-the-dark surprises. A sorority house (to include the lovely Olivia Hussey, the vulgar alcoholic Margot Kidder, and SCTV vet Andrea Martin) falls victim to vicious, violent, and altogether menacing phone calls during the Christmas holidays. Soon, students on campus begin turning up missing. Though some events do go unexplained (which could be positive, considering the mystery involved) and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts, this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films, with the most tense, moody photography ever captured on film. Keir Dullea and Margot Kidder turn in quite effective performances. Highly recommended"	1
Cool band.  worst videos ever.  ever.  makes me like them less.  Fearless Freaks is good.  This is garbage...	0
I would reccomend this film to any Robert Johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at. It includes some great interviews with Johnny Shines, Robert jr Lockwood and others who knew Robert. Its worth it just to hear Lockwood play an unrecorded song of R.J.'s! The parts where Keb' Mo' re-enacts segments from R.J.'s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman. My only criticism would be that there are few extra DVD features,however, that doesn't stop me watching this film again and again! A very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest Delta bluesmen	1
"The basic pilates mat exercises are performed, which are okay; however, the cardio segment of this video is truly lame!  The instructor runs the viewer through marching, marching and stretching one's arm at the same time and, finally, marching and kicking back one's leg.  That's it.  How incredibly dull!  What's worse, the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched-tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration.  ""Pilates for Dummies"" is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates (do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio).  I wouldn't waste your time w/ this video.   "	0
The best edition so far,however...The color is smeared and skewed just enough to bother me. But what do you want for 10 bucks? I saw Gorgo a bunch of times in first run, and I remember seeing the actual Gorgo creature on it's trailer being driven up Woodward ave in Detroit on it's way to the Fox theater. A great promo. The eyes are the thing I remember most as Gorgo rises from the sea, those red glowing eyes were just beautiful and so expressive. The color smearing just manages to obscure those eyes. But still this print is the best I've seen. If I live long enough, I hope they issue a perfect HD version of this movie. I would pay 3 times the price of this edition to get my clutches on that. But this is worth the cost. A must for any serious collector	1
I am an Alice fan, so this is far far from my favorite.  The first star I gave was simply because I love Kate Beckinsale and the movie isn't scary.  The other is because It would be enchanting for a 3-4 year old or another youngster that doesn't know anything about Wonderland.  My 9 year old even got bored with this.  Kate Beackinsale plays the Mother in the beginning, and in 1999 she was much too young to be and definitely looked so.  She just didn't look well in this movie, and everything looked so cheap and fake.  The story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out.  I would not recommend this.  I would recommend the 1999 American mini series of Alice in Wonderland, it is my absolute favorite; with Martin Short as the Mad Hatter, and a long list of big names.  That one is fun for all ages	0
I am saying this as an Italian American myself.. Quit bashing the show because it portrays are small portion of Italian Americans.. Its a TV show and a darn good one..It does not portray us all like that...just this mob family..so quit being so sensitive and lighten up Frances...and PS..I do not care if this was help or not either!	1
If you are looking for a dvd that is filled with White Stripes music and interviews, look elsewhere.  The item description says it has over 40 minutes of in-depth interviews, but it fails to mention that only about 10 minutes (if that) of this is actually with the band (and the 10 minutes are scattered throughout the 65 minute dvd).  It has interviews with members of various bands that have played with the White Stripes in the past and others who knew them when they were just beginning.  It is mildly interesting to hear about how the band got their start and other such details, but it is not something I will watch again.  (If Jack & Meg were telling their own story, THAT would be worth it)	0
"... for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the ""next Riverdance"". The dancers are all talented, if self-consciously hip, and in great shape. But the numbers that focus more on T & A than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me. I love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms, but ballroom dance is OTT enough ( if you've ever watched a competition) and doesn't need to be tarted up beyond recognition, the way it is here. Add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess"	0
Aside from the all-star cast, this story takes turns you'd never have guessed. It's a feel good movie in every sense of the word	1
To be honest with you I thought the movie was really bad. the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky (Rodney Eastman) was in the movie. (for about 5 mins) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars	0
"Flying Down to Rio is the film that marks the first pairing of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. The two are not the main attraction though; the film stars Dolores del Rio and Gene Raymond in a tempestuous love affair. Raymond is a band leader who always falls for beautiful women. Del Rio is engaged to a man in Rio de Janeiro but secretly harbors feelings for the American. In a back and forth romance, the two occupy plenty of the film. The rest is taken by extravagant musical numbers including ""I Like Music,"" ""The Carioca,"" and ""Orchids in the Moonlight"" on top of a wonderful number that exhibits chorus girls dancing on top of airplanes!The cast is good and the story is pretty standard, but it is the music that spices up the film. Definitly take a look at this movie, which is filled with inuendo only pre-code films could get away with and music only those early musicals featured"	1
"This has always been a favorite film of mine.  The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine.  Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD.Beware!  This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!!  No subtitles in any language,  no line 21 captioning.Nor does it have anything else.  ""Interactive Menus"" means scene selections.  This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.  Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from"	0
great book, too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds.  i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie, almost didn't finish reading it.  they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film.  on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira's voice was right on, and while the movie character of Brom was fully wasted, jeremy irons did a fine job.  i look forward to starting the next book, but will skip the next movie. 	0
"This is an O.K movie. I give it a 3.5. It starts out with the origin of Mewtwo, as using DNA from the legendary Pokemon Mew's eyebrow fossil to create a clone, Mewtwo. Soon, Team Rocket leader Giovanni tries to control Mewtwo after he destroys the lab from which he was born in, but Mewtwo has other plans, thinking his purpose is not to serve humans. So he invites the most powerful Pokemon trainers to the New Island to see who can stand up to him. But things get outta control when Mewtwo steals all the Pokemon in black Pokeballs and creates artificial ""Super-Clones"" to prove that clones are the strongest in the universe. But he didn't count on Ash, a young Pokemon Trainer. Ash destroys the cloning machine, thus bringing Mew to the scene and saving the captured Pokemon. Who'll win? The superclones or the originals? Mew or Mewtwo? You've got to see it to beleive it"	1
"I don't own a copy of the original cut, and it's been a while since I've seen the original cut.A short review of THIS version is as follows. The film print is FLAWLESS in the sense it looks like it was shot in the 70's or 80's on purpose. The blue filter is gone, so it doesn't look slick and shiny. This film is dark, rich, and grungy. Very ""noir-ish"", and warm.Obviously the running gag through out the first film was that Porter wants his 70k back... not 130k or 1 million, just 70k. This was maybe mentioned 3 or 4 times and that was it. The first cut seemed like it was being used more for comedy relief over and over and over again.Porter in this film is not charming or smooth. He's smart, violent, and cold. A true anti-hero. The annoying voice over narration is gone. There are several new characters, and several new brutal kills. Minus the credits, this film comes in at a brisk 1 hr and 25 minutes. This is a great companion piece to the great ""To Live and Die in L.A."" It got the same mood.I told you this review was going to be short."	1
"A broad range of Jewish-related-topic movies varies from ""Trembling before the G...d"" to ""The Holy Land"", where Jewish humor, emphasis on the Holocaust and musical inclusions are predominantly accustomed features of.  Of course, modern Israeli cinematograph concentrates more on day-by-day Israeli reality, incorporating      h o h m e s    (sarcastic jokes) if necessary.     Something more linking to a secular modern American reality supposedly depicted in this film does not impress me at all because of a surrealistic mixture of sex-bent traditionally-characteristic  inter-religious-confession-gesheft (profit) pieces of gay-lesbian-adultery-quickie-drug-secular-Hasidic traces of affairs, which is too much for one hour plus story of enjoying their seder continuingly.Sorry, it is definitely not my cap of tea. If even this play is R-rated.     "	0
The show is absolutely GREAT! Blue Falcon is another Space Ghost and Dynomut is the futuristic version of Scooby Doo. Dim witted and loveable. Getting the complete show is great and the shows from these HB vaults are all looking pretty good with bright and vivid colors (amid some nasty scratches and dust, but it WAS cheap animation folks). As a Scooby fan this is a MUST own! I quite enjoy the Blue Falcon/Dynomut show also. 5 stars for the show.The set however nice still drops the ball, you get two single sided dvds and two flippers. The problem with this is that the dvds are all on top of each other with maybe a 1/16th of an inch between them both. I know this was to cut down on costs but it makes the two flipper discs quite hard to get out without scratching them or marking them up with a good fingerprint smear. But then again if it was a perfect world we couldn't complain.All in all a solid set!4 1/2 out of 5	1
If you're looking for a video that doesn't take a lot of time, then this is one that you should add to your collection.  It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or have been doing this stuff for years, there are two levels to suit both challenges.  10 minutes is spent on abs, buns &amp; thighs.  You can choose to do all of them or one of them when you get a spare 10 minutes.  The exercises are great and you can feel the burn in all your muscles.  If you do this video 3-5 times a week and eat a healthy diet, you'll easily lose inches and tighten up those &quot;loose&quot; areas	1

"I saw this movie in the 1986 theatrical re-release and subsequently on DVD. I can readily attest that it does not age! I'm not even a dog person myself, but the plot is not about dogs per say, but the life adventures that a young cocker spaniel named Lady has. Living with owners named Darling and Jim Dear, Lady apparently leads a pretty good life. Assuming that every dog leads the good life she and her friends enjoy, she is later shocked to meet Tramp, who lives on the streets. However, she soon realizes that he has a good heart beneath that rough exterior. She needs his help when crusty old Aunt Sarah comes to mind the house--and the newborn baby. Initially not understanding that Lady feels protective towards the baby, she also selectively ignores the damage which her two Siamese cats were actually responsible for doing to that very elaborate Victorian house. Amazingly, Aunt Sarah presumes that Lady was responsible for wrecking the house--and attempts to muzzle her up!Like any streetwise character, Tramp has lots of connections and solutions to any problem which pops up. However, he does not come across as an annoying know-it-all who you would want to quickly get rid of. Tramp is instead somebody whom we are supposed to both identify and then want to hang out with in rough environments. Lady had 'gentle' friends named Jock and Trusty, but they can't help out in a world also outside of their own.   Of course, the spaghetti dinner scene remains one of the most enduring of all time--it made a VERY profound impact on me well before I was even old enough to myself consider dating. I imagined that I would eventually share a romantic dinner of my own with my own ""Mr. right"". However, Tramp's decision to go after the rat in the nursery also remains a powerful scene. He then felt no loyalty to anybody in that family other than Lady, but saved the baby anyway! Tramp proved that class is not a matter of breeding but what you do with your self! Despite his earlier professed discomfort with collars, Tramp ultimately gets adopted by the Darlings. Therefore, he and Lady do in fact live happily ever after. "	1
I really enjoyed this movie! Its not one of the best and a little cheesy! but easy to watch and one of the funniest films ive seen him in!Just a shame he never got to show us what a good actor he could have been	1
I was so looking forward to rewarching this movie after having not seen it for severals year. a third of a way through it, it starting to skip and freeze. I played it all the way through but took forever. At the ending it was workinhg again., But I missed a great deal of the movie because of the dmage. I guess you get what you pat for when you get it through someone and its used. Won't be doing this again!  	0
"Fraser's film is truly a winner in production quality.   His attention to detail by bringing in his theatrical savvy is a nonpareil.  Despite all the cliches that can be stated about this film; eye-candy performers, lighting, fantastic musical score, and riske scenes, this film has visually appealing sequences.  If anyone is interested in film and theatrical production, I would highly recommend the director's commentary-you really get an insight to an artist in process.  From the commentary, it seems that Fraser will never be finished with this film: a mentale that I admire in an artist.  Art is a process and is never perfect.  This is another one of those great modern plays that works very well for the film.   Getting to the roots of the human psyche is something films should continue into the future.  This film does explore the 3 dimensionality of people.   I did have a problem with the didacticism of the script however.   Though most writers try to leave it up to the audience to decide, I feel that the script gave little regard for wives who are victims of their husbands having gay affairs.  I had to agree with another reviewer who titled his review as ""Selfish gay guy ruins a marriage"". (On the other hand, Cherilee Taylor did a great job in combating this fault with the script; she wasn't quite the victim her character ultimately could have become.)  By the end of the film, I was wondering how Violet was making it as a once again as single woman.  From an audience's standpoint, we didn't really see that.  David and Kryla make up, Matt goes to illustration school, but what happens to Violet?   Overall, I would highly recommend this film.  With such a great interpretation on the screen, it would be nice to see this staged once again in the lort theatres.  "	1
This is probably the worst war related movie I've ever seen. I am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two. Time spent watching this film is time you'll never get back and have nothing to show for it	0
"I hate to trash on an American Classic... but this was truly horrible.  I thought my son would like this due to the flying car.  It took hours of TORTURE to get to that scene.  Horrible, horrible film.  Mindless, drawn-out banter, and weak story line.  Our copy eventually broke (stepped on?) --- we felt SOOO lucky to have it gone.  ""One Star"" seems like a generous rating"	0
OK, this definately looks very promising.  I saw a version of this on the Flix channel about three nights ago.  It was good.  If that is any indication on how good the show is then this Collector's Edition Box Set of the older series should be better.  I am going to purchase this soon.  Once I purchase it, I will let you know how good it really is. I'll give another review once I purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes .A month ago is when I really learned of this series so I am truly looking forward to watching this series.

"I have very fond memories of this short lived Irwin Allen classic.The picture and sound on the dvd's is better than i remember.The video transfer is very nice and the sound is crisp albeit in mono.I give volume one of the ""Time Tunnel"" five stars for pure television enjoyment.Volume one contains the first 15 episodes of the show,The unaired extended version of the pilot,Irwin Allen's behind the scenes home movies, visual effects,camera test,still galleries and promotional tv and radio spots.Once again it is lacking in cast interviews. many of the actors from this show are still alive,so why didn't the studio interview them for the dvd set?.It would be a welcomed addition to any release to see the actors today and get their thought's on the show.My only gripe is that this show only ran for one season,so why split it into two volumes?.Surely the studio could have compiled all 30 episodes into one boxed set at a reasonable price"	1
I have been following the Laughing Man fansubs, so I've covered all this material before. I'm acquiring the DVDs as they come out to have legit copies.The desc says 2 collectibles toys, it's actually 3. There is Batou on the plate like Motoko from Vol 3. In fact, the base plates fit together, which makes me belive that vol 5 will have another piece that will fit together to complete a composite set. The other two toys are the Chinese assassin with the gun-arm and the old robot unit from the organ-farming business (with the fake southern accent). These are easier to put together, I had problems with the Tachikoma from the last set, it broke when I tried to put the legs on. Haven't gotten around to the super-glue session yet.The product itself: Stand Alone Complex - 2nd Gig continues some of the best animation and smartest television ever produced. Buy it, share it with those persons worthy/capable of appreciating it	1
"I think ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"" was fine. The only sad things were when Charlie Brown didn't get any valentines until a day later, and when Linus missed giving valentine treats to his teacher. I would have felt the same way as Violet when Charlie Brown wasn't getting valentines. I would say Charlie Brown should have gotten as many valentines as the others. Everybody is too mean to him!""A Charlie Brown Valentine"" was swell because it wasn't as sad. On this one, Charlie Brown seems to go after the little red haired girl through most of it. He wanted to dance with her, but couldn't. What sounded odd to me was that Peppermint Patty sent him a valentine this time. It would only sound like her if she really loved Charlie Brown"	1
Robert Redford has proved us his undeniable artistic gifts in previous occasions, but with this giant movie he really achieved that coveted pearl; the state of art in all its wholeness.Redford crossed over the traditional concessions and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced: good taste and profitability may gather and shake hands, if you respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator.This picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most ambitious, artistic and perfect American film in the last quarter of Century; besides, the mature and sensitive script around an awful event that will transform the livings and expand the reduced frontiers of two different ways of life, enhancing them when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss.Redford' s artistic personality has a secure place in the immortality and I really hope for him to bring us future films filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity, the visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not only be absent; and so the new directors to come, understand the true cinema meaning is ART. Thanks to his generous personal effort, for having created the Sundance Festival for new directors whose fruits will create new approaches and major visions.             Special kudos to him due that clinical eye for a very young actress in progress at those years: Scarlet Johansson.  	1
The kit was not worth its price. The spatial effect is poor. I've been watching some much better 3d movies with much cheaper red-blue paper glasses.  No, I don't have visual problem, and I rigged up everything correctly.The DVDs itself were not interesting. My kids were not impressed much. It were not made me happier with the pack.Sorry this review seems against the others, but it is my truth. I've stored it back into the box.I don't recommend this for you	0
As any visual footage on Ike & Tina Turner is pretty scarce, I guess we may be thankful for this great DVD. Their 1971-show being integrally covered by Dutch television, it reveals Ike & Tina supported by a pretty good band and, last but not least, by the marvellous Ikettes. All this at a time their performance must have been at its very peak.	1
"Avril's music is ok but I hate this DVD. She's trying to be ""gothic"" or whatever and it doesn't work. It looks like she shopped at Hot Topic or something. Avril, quit being goth! You have no reason too! And you aren't gothic. Therefore, get singing lessons, and make a CD...because girl sorry you can't sing. But yeah, Avril plays the guitar so it's ok but 1 star for this goth imitation DVD"	0
I've owned this workout for about three years.  I do it on occasion if I feel like I need to slap my legs in to shape.  It does a great job of increasing muscle stamina in the lower body.  However, I have to force myself to do this video.  The 35 minute warm-up is mundane and uninspired.  By the time I finish doing the same repetitions on the same leg for 15 minutes I hardly feel like doing the whole process again for the other leg.  I also find the way the instructions are given and the background music to be extremely irritating.  In order for me to get through the video I have to put on some different music and turn the TV down until I can just barely hear the instructor's voice to know I'm keeping up with the video. In my opinion this video is more of a test of patience than a real yoga workout experience.     	0
It is the declining days of the Great War (WWI), the Germans are leaving a small French town but are leaving a little present for the advancing British troops.  They have buried the munitions in the town square.  When the town hall clerk strikes midnight the bomb will be exploded.  The town's people evacuate.  During this the barber sends off a message to the British.The British decide to send a man to check this out.  They choose the bumbling Scottish Private Plumpick (Alan Bates).  Located on the outskirts of town is an asylum.  The sisters who run the asylum escape with the town's people, leaving the inmates to fend for themselves.  They return to the town, resuming their lives before being commited.Plumpick arrives in town but doesn't know that the towns people are actually the lunatics from the asylum.  He meets the beautiful Coquelicat (Genevieve Bujold) and falls in love with her.  He finally puts everything together and defuses the bomb (of course it's more complex and hilarious than just that.)  He also finally puts together that there is something wrong with the town's people.  The funny part is he feels the lunatics have a better grasp on reality the sane people.  So shall he return to the war or stay with people he loves.This is half fairy tale and half fable.  Alan Bates gives a great performance and Genevieve Bujold shows great whimsy.DVD EXTRAS: None	1

The French title of this film is IN EXTREMIS (though translated as TO THE EXTREME) and means 'in desperate circumstances, especially at the point of death'.  Rethinking the story of this interesting but problematic movie in those terms after viewing  gives the cinematic effort more poignancy.  This is a tale of the impact of family, loss of parents, dissolution of the core unit has on us all: in this story we are asked to exam the 'in extremis' state of such trauma.Thomas (Sbastien Roch) is a hedonist, a handsome young man whose parents died in an Alpine accident, and a man who sleeps with both sexes in a confused state of true identity.  He lives with one of his female lovers who has a young teenage son Grgoire (Jrmy Sanguinetti) whom he loves as a son.  When the mother accidentally dies, Grgoire wants Thomas to be his guardian.  Thomas' lifestyle does not lend itself to fatherhood and though he deeply loves Grgoire, by law and by proclivity he cannot assume the role of foster parent.  Even with the aid of his prostitute sister Anne (Julie Depardieu) he is unable to keep the disappointed Grgoire from being sent to a prison-like orphanage.  Thomas finds solace from his lover Vincent (Aurlien Wiik) and from his excursions into the bohemian all night orgies where he attempts to forget his promise to be available at all times for Grgoire.  Eventually Thomas' devotion to Grgoire overcomes his hedonistic addiction and results in his aiding the boy's escape from the orphanage to move with him to the home in Ibiza his deceased parents owned.  The story has a bizarre but touching ending, which comes totally unexpectedly, and revealing it would ruin the impact and message of the film.Director/writer Etienne Faure ('Prisonnier', and ' la recherche de Tadzio' which is included on this CD and traces the life of the actor Bjrn Andresen who played Tadzio in the film 'Death in Venice') directs his actors well but is less successful in finding the interaction of flashbacks, fantasies, graphic indulgences and superimposed poetry inundated with noisy music.  But given these distractions the film still makes a simple case for the significance of family - genetic and extended - and therein is the power of the story.  This is obviously the work of a young director with copious ideas about film and as such one can forgive many of the early experimental indulgences because the heart is in the right place.  In French with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, May 05 	1
A good dozen years before his spectacular films of the late 70's and mid 80's Allen got his name on the directorial map w/ this piece of fluff.  You gotta start somewhere.  Tiger Lily is more of a dry run for his later, real comedies than an original film in its own right.  Allen's early work does tend to be stand up material thinly disguised as film.  Many of the jokes are funny but the one note premise wears thin quick.  A must for Allen enthusiasts and people who like quirky cultish so-bad-they're-fun movies	0
"Well, this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get, unfortunately: the female teenage protagonist (played by Witherspoon, whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here) acts masculine and heroic, the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant. At one ridiculous point, the girl runs around acting like a commando, a veritable one-gal army, blowing up the bad guys, while the boy hides in a cave sniveling. Later, when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal's backpack as they cross a desert, the gal snaps at him, Bella Abzug-style, and walks quickly ahead, leaving him in the dust. Clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here, and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men. Of course, in the real world, the result for such manly girls, once they become women, is that men do not choose them and they remain alone, and therefore become bitter--ironically and inevitably blaming men, of course. In this movie, the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy, masculine gal--but that's why they call them movies. When are these post-modern writers, artists, and other culture-shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism, they are touting something unnatural--men simply do not prefer masculine females. Men want someone to COMPLEMENT them, not COMPETE with them. Men crave FEMININITY in females, not FEMINISM. Wow, is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment! This poor teenage guy depicted in this movie, at least his character does progress a little bit: by the end of the movie, instead of craven and flippant, he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut, if that is even a step upward. But the plucky gal--she's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations.Uh, another problem with this movie--and there are many--is when the kids are going through the Kalahari Desert, something which should be, and for a time is here depicted as, a foreboding and life-threatening task. Yet we see Witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog; and we see the boy's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out-of-place manner, considering the dire situation they are in. The sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light-hearted, inane scenes.Look, I dig Disney kid movies--more realistic ones. You know, old style Disney movies. You take ""Old Yeller"" for example. Now there was a quality kid movie, and quite true to life. This movie was not. It had a plastic, spoiled-American-materialistic-teenybopper feel throughout. Disney has gone down the tubes. In any number of ways, they've been subverted by radical Marxist agendas (Note: One more of these was the fact that an African Bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his PC pagan religion--something called ""tapping,"" while the Caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un-PC Judeo-Christian religion--this is bias, folks, leftwing, PC bias, same as the aforementioned feminist bilge). I am learning to run, not walk, away from Disney stuff, and this movie was further cause for me to do so."	0
This is the French X-rated version of 99 women, directed by Jess Franco. The running time of this feature is 98 minutes, which means that this is probably the longest, least censored version of the film that is available. The story involves a women`s island prison, a sadistic female warden, a lustful male governor, and the young, lovely female inmates. Can you see where this is heading ? There ARE scenes of extreme sexuality (especially when you consider the film was released in 1969) which include (...). My big problem with this movie is that the hardcore scenes are haphazardly edited into the film. In a few cases, they don`t even seem to be part of the scenes that you have been watching. Also frustrating is the fact that some of the actors taking part in the sex scenes look nothing like the actors that they are doubling (standing-in)for. Just because a woman is wearing a blonde wig does not mean she is going to look like the lead actress that she is portraying. I guess that this movie was pushing the boundaries in 1969, but looking at the dumb story, lousy editing, and sex scenes from a 2005 perspective.....this is just a dated curio	0
"My first favorite television series was ""Twelve O'Clock High"" and I had at least two models of the ""Memphis Belle"" when I was kid, all of which simply reflects the fact that the B-17 Flying Fortress is my favorite airplane.  When I was a kid my family was driving through California and there was a B-17 parked out on somebody's front lawn on a ranch and for years I tried to figure out how to go back and see it.  A couple of decades later one of the few B-17s still flying came to the Zenith City and I finally got to go inside one (this big bombers are a lot smaller than I ever thought).  For all I know that particular B-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film ""Memphis Belle.""  When I had occasion to drive through the city of Memphis, of course I made a point of visiting Mud Island where the ""Memphis Belle"" was on display (she was moved to the Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio this October).The ""Memphis Belle"" (Serial No. 41-24485) was one of 12,750 B-17 Flying Fortresses built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over Hitler's Europe without losing a crew member.  The idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of American combat flights over Europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down.  The ""Belle"" flew from November 7, 1942 to May 17, 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by Michael Caton-Jones (""Scandal"") from the script by Monte Merrick (""Staying Together"").  That simply means that besides the fact that the ""Memphis Belle"" was named for a lady friend (Margaret Polk) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same (designed by the famous artist George Petty) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission, which was over Lorient, France and not Bremen, Germany (the ""Belle"" flew there on its 21st mission).  The names of the crew are all changed and I think the same applies to the plane's mascot, a Scotty Dog named ""Stuka.""  So if you want something closer to the ""true"" story of the pilot Robert Morgan and the ""Memphis Belle"" you want to check out William Wyler's 1944 documentary ""The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress.""What you have here instead is a Hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in World War II by incorporating a wide variety of clichs from war movies involving airplanes.  Then there is the whole idea that Americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the Nazis.  So it is we have the young and recognizable faces of Matthew Modine as the business like pilot, Eric Stoltz as the poetic radio operator, Tate Donovan as the co-pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home, D.B. Sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up, Billy Zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight, Sean Austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret, Reed Edward Diamond as the flight engineer, Courtney Gains and Neil Giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners, and Harry Connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner.  Back at the base David Strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and John Lithgow is the public relations officer the Army has sent  to celebrate the final mission of the ""Belle.""  Of course, it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the ""Memphis Belle"" is remembered for completing that final mission, so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run (the film might play better if it simply inspired by the ""Belle"" and they changed the name of the aircraft as well) .  But even if the ""Belle"" survives there are other several B-17 crews on the mission who will not.  Still, the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated, allowing Modine's character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that Americans do not believe in collateral damage.  But what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that Donovan's character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else's job. "	1
"Hollywood make them, then they break them -- stars can fall as fast as they rise. Sometimes they rise again, and sometimes they disappear. And Christopher Guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of Hollywood in ""The Big Picture,"" a quirky, cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of. It has a few awkward stretches, but overall it's a darkly witty cult comedy (""You're tracking failure all over my carpet!"").Nick Chapman (Kevin Bacon) is the winner at an arty student movie competition, and instantly agents are chasing him all over L.A. In no time, he's the Rising Young Director, with a movie deal at a major movie corporation. But he's also starting to lose sight of his old life, as he tries to become a major success.He changes the style, plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics, turning it into a beach bums/naked ghost movie. He dumps his pretty girlfriend (Emily Longstreth) for a bimbo actress (Teri Hatcher). When the studio head gets dropped, Nick falls as quickly as he rose. But a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance -- an arty music video. This time, can he get it right?Christopher Guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries, tackling everything from small-town musicals to folk festivals. His forthcoming one is another one about showbiz. But his talents are just as present in a ""typical"" movie, and Guest does a smart, quirky job of it.The lesson: Be true to yourself and your art, don't fall for empty glitz, and don't let success go to your head if you're lucky enough to get it. The story is a pretty straightforward one -- Nick gets great success, it goes to his head, he falls, and he rises again a wiser man. And the movie falls into straightforward lines, without many unpredictable plot twists. At first glance, it doesn't seem that unusual.What makes it special? Well, simply put, Guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit, like the oddballish Pez music video and the noir fantasies of Nick's life. Not to mention the glorious dialogue. When speaking of Nick's one'n'only music video, a studio woman announces, ""It's the best one yet, and I've seen 'em ALL!""And Guest manages to show us agents, artists, students, directors and actors, but never descended to cliches. They're real people, no matter how nasty. And Bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is. His best scene is the reunion with his friend Emmet, where he confesses, ""I wanna be your friend again."" And he's backed by good performances by Longstreth, Michael McKean and a dancing Jennifer Jason Leigh.""Big Picture"" treads where many movies have gone before, but it does so with an approach as fresh as a Pez People music video. A must-see"	1
"We love underdogs! Here is a plain girl who finds happiness. There is ALOT more to this character than she is given credit for.We've watched it about 20 times in the past 5 yrs. If you like ""Ugly Betty"" or any sort of Cinderella type stories - this one is for you. It is an Australian movie."	1
"This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood.  I'm not sure when this ""score"" was ""written"", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film.  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film.  With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while.  If you want an affective, edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another edition. "	0
200 American is actually quite pleasantly romantic gay comedy. Even though it looks like a no-budget episode of Queer As Folk or intended to be a gay version of Pretty Woman, it's got a pretty good story. It doesn't rely on fancy production and lighting or cinematography. Most of the actors are straight playing gay roles. I was surprised to learn from the special features material that the entire cast and crew volunteer for this show, something that I can certainly relate to. The acting is acceptable but not great, because most of the actors are not that experienced. I was surprised that there was no production and wardrobe designer! The movie has some kind of charm about it, perhaps it's because it's so sincere and gimmick free, and even the love scenes are very low-key. I was very touched by the romantic plotline between the hustler and his new boss. There is something about a straight guy doing love scene with another male actor, it's very captivating. Sean Matic did a good job with his light Austrilian accent by the way. It's worth rental fee for sure.	1
To say this film is self-indulgent is a masterpiece of understatement. Almost every joke in this movie that didn't center around profanity or flatulence was a nod to one of Smiths other movies. Maybe if you are a great filmmaker you can get away with that, but if you have only made 4 other films (very poor ones too by cinematic standards) then that just means you have the worlds biggest ego.The film looks as if it was written by a highschool kid, although the humor really dosen't reach even that level. Here is a recap of the types of humor in this film. Making fun of fans, fart jokes, scatological jokes, profanity (yes this is actually supposed to be funny in and of itself), making fun of miramax, making fun of the viewers for actually being stupid enough to pay to see this film (I swear I am not making this up), and any number of inside jokes involving the cast and crew.This movie comes across as crass, tasteless, profane and generally an abject debacle in all respects. Thank God I borrowed this movie and didn't pay anything to rent it. I won't be watching another Kevin Smith movie anytime soon	0
"I'm told by fellow film enthusiasts that Buuel's later films do not show this Spanish master at his best, that his earliest films---his famous collaborations with Salvador Dal, for instance---show an edgier, more fascinating Buuel. Whatever. I saw his 1974 film THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY for the first time recently, and I immediately fell in love with it. There are those who swear by his more popular 1972 Oscar-winner THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, but somehow I think THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is even more entertaining than DISCREET CHARM.There is no plot to speak of in PHANTOM: this film is basically a collection of surrealist sketches that finds Buuel playing with all kinds of different ideas and different images. Monks pray for a woman's sick father, and then play poker with the woman and smoke. A group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets, and go to the bathroom to eat in private. Two parents desperately try to find their missing daughter---even though she's right there in class when they call her name. In the universe Buuel concocts in THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY, anything goes.The amazing thing about this movie is that, instead of seeming like an irrational series of surrealistic sketches, THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY has a broad theme to support its free-form structure: it's Buuel's comic vision of freedom run amuck. Sure, the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone...but, as Buuel seems to be suggesting, even freedom has its limits. The opening scene of the movie is set in Toledo, Spain in 1808, as Napoleon's troops attempt to liberate the Spanish and are greeted with cries of ""Down with liberty!"" There can be times when we want the assurance of authority, rather than the freedom to act in whatever way we please.Buuel doesn't take a stand one way or the other, really; he's just an artist who is intrigued by the idea, and his interest fuels the free-form structure of the film, and its content. Almost anything and everything he can think of---within the bounds, I suppose, of the same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film career---is thrown into this movie, and while some viewers may perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure, I found its elegant chaos exhilarating. Only a master filmmaker who had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a movie like this. I think Buuel pulls it off triumphantly here; somehow, he makes the movie seem almost logical, the way it progresses. THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is a sheer delight. Highly recommended"	1
I highly recommened these DVD's!  How exciting and refreshing it is to pop in a DVD and go back in time to the 1970's again! Its wonderful to rewatch such a a classic piece of tv!  Truly worth adding to your collection	1
My son was over 2 before we introduced BE videos.  There are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images, but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot, as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons.  Unlike some of the other BE's with random visuals, here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired.  Concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust BE video in Bonus Features. It has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons.  And no I didn't care for the commercial either...	1
"This is an amazing DVD. I read reviews online all the time saying ""anyone will like this"", but seriously. I even showed it to my mother who laughed. That's a big deal.This DVD follows these four comedians on their two week tour. Their nightly shows are spliced together with scenes of them in their bus on their way to that particular city.Also throughout the episodes, it shows the comedians in interviews discussing comedy in America during her ""time of need"", interpersonal relationships, and anything else they could think of.This DVD makes me laugh to tears every time. Literally"	1
George Clooney is about as entertaining to watch as Michael Jackson being raped by the Gorton's fisherman. His pompous, self indulgent personality is better suited for being a Walmart greeter. Except he'd probably be fired for only saying hello to himself.Clooney: GET LOS	0
I covered a similar theme in my international relations MA - whilst any programme made for TV has to be reasonable breif on the subject, I found this to be a very well argued and produced programme.I recomend it, not so much as some dark conspiracy, but more a genuine question about large private interest with huge influence in a democratic country. We should question to make sure that what happens in our name, is always in our interest	1
"This is a fantastic version of TAMING OF THE SHREW.  For anyone who is interested in really studying the text (and hearing it spoken correctly), this is the version for you!  The actors speak clearly and loudly and the main point is that they completely understand what they are saying - (yipee!) They also have an uncanny way of ""speaking the speech"" which gets it across to the audience as clear as day.  You dont need to understand 'Shakespearean verse' to see this performance.  The actors breeze through this with ease and simplicity and look like they are having a blast - which I belive they are!"	1
I love Speilberg films, I really do, but the fact that he is a good director is no excuse for this crap. I just do not like it, its not my thing. I can't belive that Richard Dreyfuss turned down reprising his role in Jaws 2 because he was filming this nonsense. If you want to watch it, then go ahead, we all have different tastes. However, if you want to see a real Speilberg film, watch ones like Duel, Jaws, ET, Schindler's list, Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, and The Indiana Jones Trilogy	0
This is a typical (semi slapstick) Gaiday film. It is corny, well produced, and will please anyone who enjoys the upper crust of silly comedy. The subtitles are just fine. You do not have to understand any Russian to laugh at this movie. Buy it, and enjoy	1
This thing came off as 10 episodes of a weekly night time soap that was squished down into 3 hours.  Characters weren't given clear introductions or motivations, they react in ways that don't make much sense and the accents come, go, and change into new accents altogether.  While the format reminds me of a primetime soap, the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime: which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people involved	0
As the US European Command A-2 (Director of Air Intelligence) during this phase of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, I was surprised to see the ending -- what happened to the admiral and pilot. Historical? No way! The only plane shot down was a single-seat US Air Force F-16 pioted by Capt McBrien (sp?) while on combat air patrol (CAP), no cameras. Some naval F-14s carried film-loaded cameras in pods, but most of the imagery pin-pointing mass graves came from U-2s and satellites (and good coordination with French peacekeepers on the ground). So, this movie was fiction. It could have conveyed a better message, a better review of the decay of the former Yugoslavia and the dominant role of Serbian forces. But the producers decided action via fiction was better than learning fact	0
I would recommend this Mel Brooks movie if you're in the mood to see slapstick comedy with many popular comedic faces.  You'll come away repeating some of the catch phrases and dialog.  I first saw it when it came out and still laugh when I see it.  Mel Brooks is a genius	1
This DVD is great, heck, it has the Nickel on the cover! Anyways, this DVD has a bonus feature of Mac's amazing three point flurry vs. San Antonio earlier this season - in its entirety, they used the TNT broadcast. A must have just for that alone!It also has Franchise's game winner during opening night, Fisher's 0.4 shot, Wade's heroics, and of course the classic endings, like Rik Smit's buzzer beater vs. the Magic in 1995, Larry Bird's game-winners, and can't forget about the best one of them all, MJ's final shot in 1998. Another bonus feature is all of the recent buzzer beaters from Horry, Carter, Iverson, and Marbury	1

"This film was probably hurt a bit by the fact it had to have its fall 2001 release postponed due to 9/11(it's plot included terrorists that sell a bomb). I also imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on Tim Allen and the comparisons to ""Get Shorty"" rather than as a plot driven movie. I tell you though, this film is simply funny. Just like an old Marx Brothers film, the plot is there only to set in motion the quick-witted dialogue and interaction between the characters. I have enjoyed both of Dave Barry's humor novels(this and ""Tricky Business""). They made me laugh out loud as did this movie. I think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly.  For those that have laughed at Dennis Farina from his roles in ""Get Shorty and even ""Snatch,""  he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks(literally) on his trip to do a quick sniper job.  Tom Sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you'll ever see. There are some movies that you may see once in the theaters yet can watch over and over everytime it is on tv because it retains the ability to always make you laugh, no matter how many times you have seen it. Check this one out! "	1
Maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with Chekov's work and therefore have no preconceived notions, but I found this British made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre-revolution Russia. The story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose, and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy, sentimental, or even tragic	1
THE STORY OF NASA'S SUCESSFULL FAILURE! ! !This movie is base on Jim Lovell's book LOST MOON, the title coming from the fact that EVERY other astronuat that went to the moon the first time would walk on it the second. Lovell is the ONLY man to circe it both times he went there! What makes this film so realistic is that Dave Scott (7th man out of 12 to walk on the moon)was technicial advisor on the film. I've known the story of the flight very well for years before the film was released, and watching the film I'd say to myself that this is about the time that XXX happened and sure enough a few minutes later it sure did!Look quick at the very end of the movie for the REAL Jim Lovell, he's the Navy Captian with gray hair shaking T. Hanks hand!see the IMAX version last. Several scenes have been edited out	1
After two decades since watching Upstairs Downstairs, I rashly decided to buy the WHOLE set!!!!  As I watched the first episodes I realized my memory had played a scurvy trick on me! The melodrama was a bit vulgar and VERY predictable! Later episodes of the set improved, but not by much! It was like watching a biplane that didn't quite make it over the trees at the end of the runway. I hope you won't make the same mistake I did	0
one of the worst Van Damme movies of all time, this one and Derailed and Replicant and Knock Off, come of Van Damme baby, make good ones and have good directors too. this one has Van Damme after Mickey Rourke who Rourke ends up killing him or he thinks he killed him, then Van Damme goes to an island of lost dead agents and villians(corny). he escapes retardedly and then goes back to save his wife and his up and coming child(who Van Damme and Rodman almost indanger the poor kid, bastards). Van Damme gets help from puke and choke Rodman and they have awesome adventures and eat lots of candy, no wait, thats what I was thinking and then, no. but there's some, I SAID SOME, good action, but then it dies and sits there. the end with an oiled up shirtless Rourke and the tiger lets the suspense and action down. strickly for fans of the movies Van Damme was crappy in. this is repuked up snot on a seseame seed bu	0
I bought the Faith Hill DVD to hear her sing but instead the songs were interrupted with talking.  I would rather have had the talking put to one side and be able to place the music uninterrrupted. Wish I could get my money back!!! So spend your money on another DVD	0
"I think Woody Allen is the best director currently in the business and I believe his serious-themed movies are the reason.  He excells at making us look at ourselves.  If I'm not mistaken, ""Interiors"" was his first venture into dramatic movies.  For having led the way, this movie is noteworthy.  However, it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the Woody Allen movie.  It defines the Woody Allen film by showing us what it is not.  Woody Allen's greatness is in being able to let us take a critical look at ourselves.  His characters have faults that we share.  Whatever passions that we have fallen prey to, we see them in a new light through Allen's masterful script and direction.  The problem with ""Interiors"" is that most of us could not relate to the problems that the characters in ""Interiors"" have.  Many of them belong under the category of mental illness while others are taken too far to the extreme to be relevant to us.  Woody was on the right track but he was overly influenced by Ingar Bergman.  Allen's own style quickly emerged after this movie and we have been the better for it.  Taken in its' own right, ""Interiors"" is an above-average movie.  The acting is excellent and the mood of the movie is very tense in a somber manner.  The movie is simply overwhelming and we are left wondering who would ever have been so deranged as to have married into this mess.  These people deserve themselves and that is an observation that applies to no other Woody Allen cast (with the bumbling exception of the cast of ""What's New Pussycat?"").  Woody Allen took a turn towards drama and hit a speed bump on the way.  Fortunately, he learned from his experience. "	1
yeah. it's true. this movie is awesome. i think i watched it four times in the first week i had it	1
This is my second favorite John Woo movie with great touches of action and drama, When I first saw this film (about 5 years ago) I wasn't used to seeing this much violence on screen (And I thought Lethal Weapon was extremely violent at that time) I was in shock and more then once my jaw dropped. This film is VERY violent But compared to other action films this is REALLY tame nowadays. The minor points of this film would be some bad acting to some worse acting in some spots, some weird cuts and editing, the subs were terrible, as the same with the audio quality and some of the camera work is bad, but this is John Woo's first (if you can count heroes shed no tears) landmark heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could have done worse MUCH worse. Yun fat chow, Ti Lung and Leslie Chung have their good moments to bad moments, most of the good moments goes to Chow and Ti while Leslie had only one or two moments. The plot is like this A cop must confront his criminal brother. That's it. If your the typical Hollywood action goer this is your perfect find. But as I said if your new to the heroic bloodshed films don't make this your first one, I'll say stick with the killer and hard boiled for a few weeks then move on. But if your the Hollywood action movie goer make this your first if you can handle it move on to the other heroic bloodshed films and so on. This film is a big landmark in the action genre and a even bigger landmark to the underground action genre. I really recommend this film to any action fan!!!!	1
I really liked this movie. I thought it was a great super hero movie that had some humor built into it. It was well told and the characters were well developed. The special effects were great too!! I am not one for comic book heros, but this one confinced me otherwise. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a good over evil story that was orginally a comic book character.	1
There is NOTHING in this DVD that wasn't in the book.  In fact, Stan and John basically read the book to you as they show you the pictures from the book.  I was hoping to actually SEE the artists do the drawings, but there is maybe 60 seconds total of footage of actual drawing.  The rest of the video is just John Buscema tracing over all the images that are already in the book.  If you really want to learn to draw comics, this isn't for you.  If you just want a basic overview of the process, this dvd might not be TOO disappointing.  But if you already own the book, DEFINITELY don't waste your money.  It would be cheaper just to have your mom read the book to you	0
"This could possibly be the cheesiest movie I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot of movies!)  Do not waste your money on this low-budget, low-acting-ability, low-camera-experience movie.  I enjoy a good ""gay movie"" every now and then and this was not it.  Sorry to disappoint"	0

I like this season because it has moved out of the developing storyline and gone into conflicting with each other with two of the best twist in a show ever!	1
Charles Laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as England's King, Henry the Eigth, who infamously married six different queens, divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted.  The script to this magnificent Alexander Korda production is a witty jab at English history buffs, touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of Ann Boleyn,  concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty, capacious King. Laughton, as ever, is a marvel, skillfully presenting Henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout, and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity.  Viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point: this is all about the cleverly-rendered script, which turns British schoolboy lessons on their heads, and on the classy ensemble acting, which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print (I'm writing in the year 2003; perhaps Criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon).  Still, fans of early British cinema will enjoy this film a lot	1
"I guess I understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it's year of release, 1986.  Prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of ""Purple Rain,"" both the film and the soundtrack.  And critics love to knock someone off a pedestal, which is what they did to Prince in those days.  Many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip.  They couldn't believe Prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself.  It was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that isn't trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy. Of course, poor critical response alone doesn't usually keep the public from making a movie popular.  Yet ""Under the Cherry Moon"" was a bomb at he box office.  Probably the main reason for this is that the movie, although shot in color, was released in black-and-white.  For some unfathomable reason, the general movie-going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black-and-white movie.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves.  I'm only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color.  I will acknowledge that this movie's target audience is Prince fans.  Since I am one myself, and have been most of my life, I'm not the most entirely objective viewer.But I make no apologies for my love of this movie.  It's not a ""guilty pleasure"" for me, because I proudly hold this as one of my favorites.  I had only seen it a couple times before the DVD release - and unfotunately I missed it in theaters (I couldn't get anyone to take me, I was only 12 and none of my friends were into P and certainly not my parents - though my dad went with me a few years later to see ""Grafitti Bridge"" on opening night, but that's for another review).  But since it's DVD release in 2004, this has become one of my most-watched discs in my collection.The soundtrack is KILLER, the tunes make up one of the best Prince albums ever.  There's even some great stuff heard in the movie that didn't make the album (some of which was issued on 12"" vinyl).  Plus, I think the movie looks great - the cinematographer was Michael Ballhaus, who has multiple Academy Award nominations to his credit (and was the DP on numerous Martin Scorsese classics).  I wonder how the movie would feel in color, but I do think black-and-white was the right way to go.  Even though the movie is set in then-contemporary times, it has the feel of something from the '30s.  There are so many classic moments in this movie, I won't try to list them all.  But here are a few... Christopher Tracy (Prince) giving his ""Bela Lugosi eyes""...Tricky (Jerome Benton) tossing rose petals into the tub while Christopher takes a bath...Christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery...the ""Wreka Stow"" scene...the car race between Christopher and Mary Sharon (Kristen Scott Thomas).As for the acting, I've heard a lot of people saying that Prince's performance was no good.  I don't see much truth in that claim.  After being so serious in ""Purple Rain,"" it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this.  Jerome Benton proved he could do just fine even without Morris Day at his side (as in ""Purple Rain"") - I'm surprised Jerome hasn't done much additional acting outside of Prince movies.  And obviously Kristen Scott Thomas moved on from this, her first major role, to become an Oscar-nominated, highly repected leading lady.  How is the DVD presentation?  Pretty good, for such a largely overlooked movie.  The widescreen transfer and 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything phenomenal, but get the job done nonetheless; the movie looks and sounds fine.  As for features, anyone expecting a full-blown Special Edition like the 2-disc ""Purple Rain"" will be disappointed.  But at least it's not a completely bare-bones release - four music videos are included, though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio/visual quality (though they are passable, I would've preferred 5.1 mixes).  The highlight is the live performance of ""anotherlover"" which was taken from a never-released (at least not domestically, not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the U.S.) concert video documenting the Parade tour.  MTV held an interesting (i.e.- very weird) contest to determine where ""Under the Cherry Moon"" would have it's world premiere.  The ten-thousandth caller to an MTV hotline would accompany Prince to the premiere, which would be held in their hometown.  MTV ran a special that covered the premiere party - and unlike the premiere of ""Purple Rain"" unfortunately this program is not to be found on ""Under the Cherry Moon""'s DVD release.  Lisa Barber was the contest winner, and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of Sheridan, Wyoming - a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere.  When asked what he thought of the town of Sheridan, Prince summed it up with a single word: ""Purple."""	1

The devil's backbone is a horror movie like you've never seen before - a good and intelligent one.. It really is not a horror movie, however, but a story which involves ghosts (or the past) and how they fuel our present actions and decisions.. It is a strange and memorable film from spain which will make you think as much as it scares you.. worth seeing.. 	1
I was like the previous reviewer.  I had rented it and after watching it the first time, purchased it before I had even returned the rental!  I loved the content, it gives one hope and a small glimpse into what lies beyond our human experience.  How lovely to know that there is a life we can barely imagine, waiting to be returned to.  And I didn't learn this fact from the video, I have been studying this subject for many years and already believe, no I KNOW, that there is more that lies beyond this brief stay on Earth.  This video illustrates it so beautifully with people who have had a glimpse into that wonderful place that is our true Home.  People who are dying yet unafraid as they are being shown what is yet to come.  My own Mother saw her Mother as she died.  She came to take her Home.  There is no specific religion addressed here, only the fact that there is more to life than living and dying.  And that it is something to be totally unafraid of.  In fact physical death is only the beginning of something great; it is a step in the evolution of our souls	1
Black Hawk Down hasn't got an interesting story on offer. When a bunch of marines is stranded in Mogadishu, Somalia all hell breaks loose as militants start attacking them. From there it is just angry men running and shooting. Although this is what you would expect from a war movie, Black Hawk Down remains way below average. I think this movie could have done better with some obvious main characters. Now you barely get a chance to start caring about what happens to the soldiers. Now you have so many qualified actors doing nothing but firing guns. As this movie was based on events that truly took place, probably Americans will appreciate Black Hawk Down a little more.

Using the G8 Summit and negotiations over debt relief as the background for a romantic comedy seemed (at least to me) like a recipe for disaster, but thanks to great writing and an amazing performance by Bill Nighy,  The Girl in the Cafe is an unexpected gem. Don't miss it.	1
"special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment.      welcome to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch of people get to the park,the robots begin to have breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as ""to far out there,no one will believe it"" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest.  the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad. a very fun movie"	1
Running with Scissors is a slice of life movie which spends time leering into the lives of eccentrics and then ends with no revelations or culminating event.  Unfortunately what comes before the movie fails to culminate is not very profound or insightful.  It is marginally entertaining and somewhat troubling.  The lead character in the movie is a 15-year old.  His parents divorce, and his selfish mother sends him to live with her charlatan psychoanalyst and his similarly-acquired family.  Lead is on course to become a writer (who eventually writes the non-fiction account upon which this movie is based), but we see little of his efforts to develop himself as a writer.All the performances were serviceable, save for Gwyneth Paltrow, who lazily regurgitates a role she played previously.  Annette Benning is also essentially revisiting a role she played in a better movie.  Mrs. Benning performed excellently and selflessly, but the similarity of the roles intruded on my view of the movie.  It is a sure sign that Hollywood is producing too many dysfunctional family flicks when all actors have been consigned to act in them and some actors are serving a second term.   Also growing tiresome is the treatment of gays in movies.  The presence of one or more characters has become a requirement in films that explore a set of quirky characters.  Furthermore, the gays are stereotypically endowed with greater passion and depth of emotion, and are put-upon or stifled by the stodgy straights.  The most promising characters are the psychoanalyst's wife and adopted daughter.The movie has some colorful and funny scenes, but these are not enough to justify a viewing	0
I bought this DVD on the basis that Shania Twain performed the half time show. Even when i did a search for Shania Twain this DVD was listed - INCORRECTLY - as there is NO Shania performance on the DVD. As far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the UK and know nothing about American Footbal - sorry!!	0
"This exhilarating musical comedy, featuring (respectively) the fancy footwork and infectious crooning of GIs Kelly and Sinatra, perfectly captures the optimistic spirit that held sway in the post-World War II boom. Co-starring dancers Vera-Ellen and Ann Miller, ""On the Town"" was one of the first color films shot on location in Manhattan, and remains one of the grandest, liveliest Hollywood musicals ever made."	1
My little boy who is 8 years old loves this movie.  He goes around acting like the characters from the movie!  He really likes Harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending.  He is also convinced that they should make a Midnight Madness 2 and let Harold win the next time!  This is a great movie, with a young Michael J. Fox in it, and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie	1
"This is a great show and very entertaining.  The story isn't the Greek classic, but it's a fine riff on it.  The songs are good, and they grow on you as you watch.  I take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the Meg character - it's just a cartoon, for pete's sake.Like some other reviewers, I was also annoyed with Michael Bolton singing ""Go The Distance"" over the end credits, but this DVD has a music video of the Spanish language version, ""No Importa La Distancia,"" sung by Ricky Martin, and it is killer!  This one is well worth the money"	1
I'm sure such a movie would be approached with much hostility if some other group or religion would be the laughing target.  To imply that Christians are typically mean and narrow-minded is pure racism;this is just as evil as implying that all Jews are rich or that all African-Americans have rhythem.  What has Jesus Himself done to warrant such Christian-bashing out of Hollywood?  The man has suffered enough on the cross; LEAVE HIM ALONE	0
"It's just like the Hit TV Show!  In fact they probably got the idea for the TV show from this movie. Actually I thought it was more of a comedy than anything. I saw it on the ""WE"" network.It's worth the price if you feel like buying it."	1

When Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs set out in their writing, they had no idea what it would create - a whole movement.  This film, including  interviews taken when Ginsberg and Burroughs were alive, assembles clips  from media, film, and personal account to show the beginnings of the beats  up to the passing-away of Ginsberg and Burroughs.  With a large assembly of  other beat writers and the poets they influenced (Carroll and Bukowski), it  is an extensive study to a misunderstood movement.  It is interesting to  see the Beat propaganda of the sixties, how negative and mocking the media  treated the sense of a &quot;cool&quot; movement; they painted a false  portrait.  This film is for lovers of Beat or people genuinely interested.   However, if you do not like documentaries, you won't like this one.  Also,  I was disappointed to see Depp, Hopper, and Turturro reciting long pieces  of work when the actual writers could have performed it.  Honestly, I  skipped these parts.  I wanted to see Ginsburg doing &quot;Howl.&quot;   Another disappointment is the DVD version, which was slapped together on  the fly.  I envisioned additional clips and useful information (let's face  it, you can put TONS on a DVD), but only had 2 or 3 screens of names  credited for making the movie and the trailer (in this case, not exciting).   However, with all disappointments aside, this film is good for a few  viewings.  It conveys a better picture of the Beats than other films have  before and enjoyed alot of the material	1
"Okay, the rating above is not going to be liked but I have to be truthful.The only good thing going for this movie was the return of ""Snake Plissken"".This film's plot was essentially a rehash of the original ""Escape From New York""...A bit more special effects (which in fact, did not make this a better movie)... When I go to a sequel I expect to get what I paid for a totally new adventure with the same character / characters.Kurt Russell's character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them. Obviously the movie doesn't really know where it's going as it takes two scenes (15 minutes of the film) (1st scene - President, Commandant, and Lackey give Snake the mission) (2nd scene - Commandant and Lackey brief Snake before he leaves for the mission)  to explan to the audience what's the basic conflict.I guess either Carpenter or Russell are just getting too old to take a GREAT leap and recount either an earlier Snake Plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling..I also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer...""Carpenter....Russell! "" Please don't tell me ""money"" caused you to revisit a ""cult figure""! Some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of  Cliff Robertson, Stacy Keach, Steve Buscemi, and Pam Grier.  Robertson, Keach, and Grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters!Sorry, Snake....""I don't love L.A.""The-Big-Green-Pointy-Eared-One! "	0
I don't want to spoil this movie for others and I won't. CACHE is French for HIDDEN and  alot was left hidden. Why does the son suddenly do what he did? Why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she's doing? I didn't care one bit about any of the charactors. This is a slow going movie with no conclusion. If you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry, flip a coin. I watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most US made films. Not this one.	0
"I was eager to see this movie, having loved the original ""American Werewolf"" movie; but was sadly disappointed.  I didn't care at all for the characters, the humor was missing completely and generally it stank up the screen.  Mark me off if you don't agree - I know you rude lot will anyway - but that's my story and I'm sticking to it"	0

I LOVE BRITNEY so i went against the bad reviews!MAN WAS I WRONG it is sooooo bad!!its the worst dvd in history	0
This movie is a rehash of the first, but it is a crappy, unconvincing, emotionally uninspiring movie. Let me guess what part 3 will be about: A guy who looks at video or pictures goes back in time, does not alter that timeline the way he wants (i.e. always worst case scenario) and ends up killing himself in the end for the sake of everyone else	0
This movie is great. I just bought it the other day and rushed home to watch it. I throughly enjoyed it entirely, I believe it kind of relates to Fatal Attraction	1
"Francisco was right, this film is about as well-conceived as buttcrust.The review on the back of the dvd says ""jaw dropping, "" but the full quote probably reads ""jaw dropping (because i was lulled to sleep like a baby)"". There is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage, in the zombie attack scenes, but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of this film consists of the ear-bleeding whines and yawn-inducing infighting of the human characters, ill-conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo-cynical and extremely redundant ""evil side of human nature"" message that would be better left to Jean Renoir (or even Adam Sandler considering the results here). I don't watch zombie movies for the characters, especially characters so vapid and unengaging. It seemed like the script writer read a novice's How To pamphlet and said ""yeah, it needs some CONFLICT"". If these characters weren't so constipated and bloated I'd give them a chance. One Amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one-dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of ""social commentary,"" but that's just a mindless knee-jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully. It wasn't.  You'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass. The critical ambitions of this movie are ill-fitting and embarassing, and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director's real talent, which is (you guessed it) the lovely undead. The rest is monotonous dreck.   I don't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man's dramatic rags. All that aside, the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop-out in the history of horror movies. A horror movie that sucks for 3/4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself, but the cut-away at the end makes you wanna kick the director in the gonads. Sorry, but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite-repeating moron. "	0
I think Pauly Shore is much more talented then people give him credit for.  It is not as easy at it seems to play the character he played in every single one of his films.  But the problem is that he has played the same character in all the movies he made.  Frankly I dont think he made this movie or started his new reality show to restart his career, I think he probably knows that he is a living joke, I feel he is just trying to give people a laugh and I'd say hes done that	1
The book offers what feels to be a valuable revelation about improving your game.  The information is well presented and the CD is a nice addition...but really i think counting the the tempo/timing to yourself would be more effective; at least that worked better for me	1
I really enjoyed this DVD-and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns.The instructor actually starts with the left foot , so you can follow her mirror image.I teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves.And, you will work up a sweat, if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march.  Enjoy	1
 The direction was A grade acting top class and to top it you had Eric and Clint eastwood .Eric fleming was mindblowing .One has yet to come across  an actor with his confidence class and authority .Yes I agree we always tend to focus on Clint forgetting that it was Eric who was mile ahead of him.Todays generation has to watch these episodes in black and white to understand the beauty of this great western.Yes the fact is without Rawhide there would be no Clint Eastwood	1
"Well not to bad a deal.Most of the movies here aren't too bad(The Inspector General,A Farewell to Arms,A Star is Born etc;)and have basically clear picture and sound quality.It's true several of these are silent but even a few of those are good.There is a problem with this set however,after you've watched these movies once they will begin to wear out my mother and I discovered this when we wanted to watch ""The Flying Deuces"" for the second time the film was a lot more blurry and it was difficut to hear some of the dialogue.My advice is not buy this collection unless you find it for sale VERY cheap,and to just rent some of the better ones.We did get a few things out of this my mother said that she discovered Buster Keaton,W.C.Fields and Charlie Chaplin because of this for instance,(and after we liked Father's Litle Dividend we decided to watch Father of the Bride which was even better)so I have decided to give it an extra star just for that"	0
"I'm a big fan of The Sopranos so obviously the F word doesn't bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the F word and MF. The stories and characters are superficial, boring and unintelligent.   People who like this show are the same people who think that what makes The Sopranos a great show is because people get ""whacked"" a lot. "	0
I saw this movie in a trip and it is one of the worst movies I have seen during the last two years. Stupid, stupid and stupid. Ryan Reynolds becomes annoying.If you have brain, never watch this movi	0
I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone. Due to a high content of bad words, screaming and violence, it's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. Some people really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other two people I know who watched it. Some violent parts are a bit hard to believe, but I guess that's what the story is about. This movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies. There's one good idea in this movie and that's how life develops as it goes along, and one action or inaction changes how life plays out. But this is no where near original, even the Simpsons had an episode like that. So, this movie is definitely not on my best movies list.	0
We have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there. There is no rhyme or reason to the story. I gave it two stars because the landscape is great	0
My whole family (ages 7-68) greatly enjoyed all the Horatio Hornblower movies together.  They are well made and great entertainment--a very acessible way to learn about the Napoleonic Wars.  It gives the viewers a real sense of how highly held personal honor and integrity used to be.  We can't wait for A&E to continue the series	1
"Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. (""Crash"" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would ""change the world"".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...  And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch ""Trainspotting"", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and ""Bubba Ho-Tep"", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as ""Requiem For A Dream"", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.  ""Requiem For A Dream"" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over. Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.Grade: D+ PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows"	0
"The review on the cover of the DVD reads ""A snappy, sexy thriller..."" I must disagree. This was the most unsexy, and unthrilling movie I've seen in a long time. In my opinion Ashley Judd doses not fit this roll, it's almost comedic.Twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting. Seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had. I have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production. The film's ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination. My vote? Just okay, nothing to write home about"	0
"First of all, this is NOT the worst movie ever made, nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars. The worst movie ever made was ""Autumn in New York"", but that is a different review. No, this not a great movie, but it is very interesting. And for once, thank God, it doesn't end with everything tied up in a pretty Hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone. It has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie. And the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie, bleak.More interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack, this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing. For Molly Ringwald, she didn't do anything of note again until ""The Stand"" six years later, and for Andrew McCarthy, well it could be argued that he still hasn't starred in anything of note again (although he probably made some money from ""Weekend at Bernies"" I & II).Anyway, probably better to rent than buy, I am only buying it to complete my 80's collection.

"This film sucked harder than a boatload of whores during shore leave. I originally saw it for free and afterwards, I still felt screwed. It stank so badly that I checked the soles of my sneakers on my way out of the theatre. Yeah, I know. Call me ""Mister Tact"".A ""horror-comedy"" that's neither slightly funny nor remotely scary, this film is a supposed sequel to the 1981 horror classic ""An American Werewolf in London"", (which is possibly the best werewolf film ever made). The filmakers had a lot to live up to and, boy, they blew it in every department. The effects were ludicrous, the cast was lost, the script was bathroom tissue with identity issues, and the director should have been shot (with something other than lots of narcotics). This film is a textbook example of the Hollywood machine clanking its way through a total goatscrew.If you have already been suckered into buying this DVD, I feel your pain. You are undoubtedly now using it as a coaster for a Heineken or as a tool to chisel old dingleberries out of your asscrack"	0
I take this title form the video store thinking in Wynton Marsalis.When I was watching the DVD I can appreciate that the image is very good (not great, and I have a 720p tube TV) and the sound is very good also(not great, I have a reference equipment).But the show is so boring Look, you just desire this man stop to blow. The drum's solo is just awesome, but the rest of the show is to forgive about it	0
This film i have to say is beautiful looking, from the characters to the landscape. Although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes, it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects. The only problem is the love between the two main characters . The movie never lets you feel the love between them , and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway  i mean it is called heart under blade right?  The main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it. This film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals! 	1
I saw the scene,where they have Lissa chained to the pool table and gagged in the basement.I didn't understand most of the movie. I bet Kim Possible,Ron Stoppabl,and Rufus can deal with them	1
This is an honestly forgivably slightly too long film that manages to be surprisingly crass with three dimensional characters and capture much of war's bad brutality (but necessity hey the men and women set fire to are all deranged nazis). I love the scenes best where Sutherland plays a general and the part where the english chicks show up at sort of dance with the dozen (interesting if English Jill Ireland had been one of the ladies there--with Charles Bronson looking at her-- which she wasn't---but the mostly hot chicks they have do just fine). Before I saw the film I heard Ernest Borgnine was in the movie and I thought he was going to be one of the dozen. There is no really solidly likable member of the dozen (Sutherland's probably the closest they come to this and he is rather undeveloped) and Borgnine could have fit the bill very nicely had he been a convict--instead they've got him in a more dull role of a general. But what the dozen lack in likability they make up for in interest. Cassavettes (whom I strongly physically resemble by the way) is outstanding as the most crooked but slickest member of the dozen and he shines best. Savalas is next best as the lust hating psycho (hey sex between men and women is needed to produce babies, Telly, or the human race would have ceased to exist a long time ago and the book of Genesis talks of man and woman becoming one). Bronson is the true chameleon of an actor as just 8 years later he'd be the very different vigilante Paul Kersey of Death wish so different than the very tough but still gentler fellow he plays here. Marvin brilliant in the lead as the head major leading the dozen(probably even better than the very good John Wayne would have been). Nice turn by Bob Ryan as a decent colonel who rather understandably makes things hard for the covert dozen. The rest of the cast is mostly very good too. Very good film!	1
"With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love.  This film felt like a ""blind date"" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose.  Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the clich use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame.  Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale.  She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes.  I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors.  Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth.  Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally.  Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character.  His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant.  I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film?  There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' ""Looking at America"" class.  I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film.  Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn.  There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about.  I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film.  He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for.  I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way.  Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well.  Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature.  Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story.  I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met.  I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture.  I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just ""played it safe"".  The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin.  Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character?  I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters.  The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table.  I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further.  Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film.  The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old.  I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be!Grade: ** out of ****"	0
This movie showed what an amazing dancer Gene Kelly was. This is one movie I recommened for anyone who loves the world of dance, thinks Gene Kelly is Hot (lol) or if you love musical theater.	1
After I watched this sequel I realized it was not as good as the first but I did enjoy it. 	1
"The funny thing about this movie is that I read negative reviews here, and rather agree with what they assert: that the plots and some of the characters are not very ""evolved"" due to time. If you disect the movie, yes this is *true.*NONETHELESS, I love this movie! I love watching the what the actors DO with this material, and how they manage, with so little time, to invest the viewer in their story. Emma Thompson gives a perfect performance, I think, highlighting how complicated long marriages can become, and the pitfalls of being ""too functional."" Bill Nighy is hilarious, acting as the needed jolts in between serious moments...quite refreshing.   Most of all, it is genuinely funny.  Life can feel (or at least my life can feel) disjointed, and I love a movie where a larger pattern emerges from seemingly chaotic events and connections. "	1
Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look act so dumb by English Dubb. ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots, and bulls though	0
"Truth be told, I should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and I think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively.  When this thing gets going, though, The Descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status, and on top of all the incredible special effects, oppressive atmosphere, and grievous bloodletting (made with a pretty limited budget, by the way), one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner.  Are you kidding me?  Blood, gore, a claustrophobic atmosphere like you wouldn't believe - and subtlety?  How could I not give The Descent five stars?So you've got these young British women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky, extreme activity.  White water rafting, for example.  Everyone has fun, but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), forever.  Still recovering from her terrible loss, Sarah joins her friend Beth (Alex Reid) in America, where mutual friend Juno (Natalie Mendoza), an Alpha Female if there ever was one, has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored.  Joining in the fun are Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), Juno's new gung-ho sidekick, and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet.  The movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the Appalachians (apparently somewhere in the North Carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the UK), then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure.  Once they descend into the cave system, though, things start getting more intense fairly quickly.  Their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal, especially for Sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses.  That's when Juno, a woman with more than her fair share of secrets, admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before, supposedly to help reunite the group.  Well, it does just the opposite, but they just have to keep going.  If there is a way out, they're going to have to find it the hard way.Things are already creepy enough at this point.  The filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets, making the viewer feel as if he/she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters.  Just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight, dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic.  But the real fun was just about to begin.  In the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you'll ever want to squirm through, Sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them.  No one believes her - at first.  When the ""crawlers"" attack, though, all hell breaks loose two miles under ground.  These Gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind, albino humanoids who hunt by sound, can scamper and climb like monkeys, move unbelievably quickly, and really tear into whatever flesh they can find.  Not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves, the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light.  And when the girls fight back, it's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy, bloody, gruesome department.  And even as characters are fighting for their lives, a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher.  The ending is a little controversial because American theatrical audiences didn't get to see the true final scene of the film, for some pretty questionable reasons.  A few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference.  Don't worry, though, as the DVD has both endings available.The Descent draws deeply from the well of man's most instinctual fears, making it one of the most atmospheric, heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while.  The subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between Sarah and Juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here.  The Descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that.  If you care the first thing about horror, you must see this atmospheric tour de force"	1
The animation ... Excellent.  The characters ... Excellent.  The premise ... Excellent.  Laugh lines ... plenty of them and well executed.This is a movie you will say was worth spending your money on.THE PROBLEM IS ... as adults you will understand the movie is about putting the past to rest so you are free to enjoy your now and your future.For kids, they don't see a lesson in putting your past to rest, they see - If you don't like something - put IT to rest ... as is R.I.P. - DEAD!After the crotchety old man (doesn't every haunted house need one to heighten the tension) identifies the haunting is related to someone he knows ... there is far too personal a vendetta to finish them off (again).Also shame on the producers of this movie... a KIDS movie ... there is far too much irresponsible adult behaviour (babysitter getting it on with boyfriend, boyfriend getting drunk and threatening the kids, etc) -- it is just not necessary to tell this story. I wouldn't let any relative of mine, under 14, see this otherwise excellent flick	0
"Many, many years ago when I was a very young woman, I saw my first Carry On movie and went to see every one I could possibly get to.  Then, there were none.  Several years ago, my sister taped a copy of Carry On Cleo for me. I couldn't believe I still roared at the silliness only the Brits can successfully pull off.  It must have been fate that led me to look up ""Carry On"" on amazon a few months ago.  My heart skipped a beat when The Carry On Collection came up.  I instantly made it mine and have watched most movies several times.  My personal favorites:  Carry On Constable, Carry On Cowboy, and Carry On Cabby.  But they are all good.  I've loaned several movies to a Brit here in the office who has seen all 27-something of the Carry On series and who is now introducing them to his American family.  They love them, too.  If you love double-entendre done to perfection, don't miss this collection"	1

"Coming out at the same time as Ken Russell's rather more amusing Valentino, The World's Greatest Lover suffers from Gene Wilder's sporadic tendency to mistake the grotesque for the side-splitting. Thus we get the odd huge close-up of mouths covered in shaving foam and a lot of tiresome hysteria and tongues. We also get far more of Dom DeLuise mugging away as if semaphore were back in fashion than is strictly necessary, though he's not as OTT here as in Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother, for which we can at least be grateful. Unfortunately, we get much more of Wilder's tendency to mistake hysteria for the hysterical - when in doubt, shout seems to be his motto - with Wilder adding a nervous tic that sees him stick out his tongue when he gets nervous. And he gets nervous a lot. Be still my aching ribs...It's a reworking of Fellini's near career killing early flop The White Sheik, even including a Felliniesque lineup of hookers at a bus stop in one scene, only without Fellini's restraint (yes, you did read that right), with Wilder's unemployed baker heading for Hollywood to enter a screen test to find the next Valentino while his young wife seeks out the real thing. Wilder does acknowledge the debt in a screen credit that's part thank you to `my friend', but seems more name-dropping in a film that comes across as something of a vanity project - certainly with Wilder starring, writing, directing, producing and even writing a song for the film, it's fair to say where the buck stops on this one. One of those films that at once offers fairly lavish period production design but often a complete lack of understanding of silent cinema - yes, we do get sped-up comedy scenes - it's definitely pre-Kevin Brownlow's Hollywood, which completely destroyed most of the then-common myths about silent cinema that this embraces. Indeed, anachronisms abound, with the feel (and the songs) often more Thirties than Twenties, which perhaps wouldn't matter quite so much if it were all funnier. It's not a total disaster - there's the odd good line (a conductor announcing ""Hollywood, home of the stars and several featured players""), a nicely natural performance from Carol Kane before she became a mess of mannerisms to rival Wilder and it does offer a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see James Hong playing a Norwegian (or is it Svedish?) studio executive, complete with excellent accent. (Also to be glimpsed among the bit parts in the supporting cast are Danny De Vito as an assistant director, Billy Sands - Paparelli in Sergeant Bilko - as a studio guard and, as the boss of a bakery, David Huddleston, here billed as `Michael Huddleston's Father'!) Fox's DVD offers a decent 1.85:1 widescreen transfer as well as a fullscreen version, with optional original mono or remastered stereo mixes. Aside from the theatrical trailer and trailers for three other Wilder films (Young Frankenstein, Sherlock Holnes' Smarter Brother and Silver Streak) the only extra is an audio commentary by Wilder that is so sparing and uninformative that you'll wonder if you clicked the wrong button on your menu"	0
This movie is not a war movie. It is not remotely related to history either. Guadalcanal was not like this as anyone who knows the people who fought there and the history. Since when did American troops in WW II carry pliers around to extract gold teeth from dying enemy soldiers? This depiction is just simple minded and pure excrement. Enemy soldiers all hugging around and teary eyed over war is hell? Can we spell Bushido? Mallick can't. Now, if you like touchy, feely, not the real world aesthetique, have at it. The scenery and photography is quite good. 	0

Wow, how nice to watch Sam Cooke's story from beginning to end. Interviews with the family adds a wealth of inside information.

After watching this DVD, I bought Sam Cooke music and surpised that some songs are songs I had no idea Sam wrote	1
"Nowadays, Hollywood just wouldn't have the balls to make a film that spits in the face of terrorism, unless it was an easy target that doesn't spit back (aka, America and it's 1st Amendment).  This film harkens back to the day when people wished our country's foreign policy was a bit more leathery.  Well...ya got it now!  At the very least, a film like this would piss off the surrender-monkeys in the jackass party, not only for what they would see as a glorification of nationalistic jingoism, but for the villification and slaughter of Stalinistic, Castro-like communists that they would only want to capitulate and make peace with.  Makes one wonder if the lefty Glenn Close now hates herself for acting in such a film.  What would they say to a film like this?  Unfortunately, there's plenty of room for criticism in this movie, aside from the political implications therein.  Some (arguably, if not all) of the special effects seemed a bit hokey (hence the 4 stars instead of the five).  I think if anyone wanted to be bipartisan about anything, it would have to be the 90's style CGI, especially the plane crash.  At best, one might go so far as to say it was ""cute.""  And what can a guy like me say to that?  Even as I write this review, scarcely 2 days have past from the red letter day in the struggle against terrorism, in which the ruthless terrorist leader of al Qaida in Iraq, al-Zarqawi, caught himself a couple of 500 lb. bombs with the use of his house.  For those who want to keep westerners depressed and demoralized (not a far stretch from ""fear-mongering,"" right?) in the fight against terrorism, this deals a disappointing blow to those who hate America.  What's worse, they can't seem to ban a film exalting American nationalism such as ""Air Force One"" from those who wish to see it (oh no!).  And just 2 years ago the same whiners were bitching about ""The Passion.""  Sucks to have the 1st amendment apply to every American and not just the idealistic ""intellectual"" few, doesn't it"	1
In this movie we once again see Mad Max (sans hot car) wandering around in a Post Apocalyptic world until he discovers Bartertown in the Wasteland.Mel Gibson tries valiantly  to channel  such on screen loners as Clint Eastwood  and John Wayne but only succeeds in making his character look inarticulate with poor social  skills. However he becomes a threat to the Matriarch of the town by the name of Aunty EmTeeVee (or something like that). Then Mel kicks a lot of butt in the process. This is a dismal tedious movie which is only redeemed by the fact that it was filmed in the Outback Opal Mining Town of Coober Pedy which I visited a few years ago	1
"PRO + Great story, teriffic acting, beautiful settingCON - Some pacing flaws, but not enough to destroy the wholeLindsay Duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and Liam Cunningham is her well-cast, perfunctory foil. As as the story unfolds, the differences between British and American style (and culture) are revealed, providing a nice subtext to the plot. One of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears, from the central story to the character's lives. Good actors all. But my ""best actor"" award goes to the photographs themselves: the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once.  A visually rich film"	1
"Just today I randomly selected a movie, that movie was ""Henry"".  I had never heard of it before, and I figured that I was in for your average, run-of-the-mill low budget slasher flick.  Though it is low budget, it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie.  In fact, the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study.Meet Henry, a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition.  Watch as he goes to work, watch as he hits the bar with his buddy Otis, and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people.  This film does not exploit the violence though; it is very frank and direct, treating it as though Henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park.This movie is a lot of things, and when it was all over, I just had to sit back and take a few breaths, have a cigarette - and try to gauge my reaction(s).  I was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing, it is also pretty funny in some parts, though only funny in the blackest sense of the term.  There is no social commentary in this movie, nor does it provide any closure.  The DVD is great, awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, awaiting lethal injection on death row.  Very fascinating"	1
"As a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed City of the Living Dead and Zombie, I was very disappointed with House by the Cemetery. Fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two-thirds of the movie, only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes.House By the Cemetery is about an researcher (whose work is never specified) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in Massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress. The titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment, so Dr. Boyle, his wife Lucy and their son Bob move in despite a lot of bad signs, like the boarded-up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a Dr. Jacob Tess Freudstein in the front hall. Bob has little red-headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is (though no one else sees her). Furthermore, people keep claiming Dr. Boyle has been in town before with a non-existent daughter (which he denies, not totally convincingly). He also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter, Anne, who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night. And Lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues. Got that? Good, because half of that stuff never gets explained. The only things that get worked out are the little red-headed girl's identity and the identity of the killer (neither of which are that hard to figure out). There are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film (the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand, the photograph that changes with each viewing, a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding) but Fulci's ability to handle the gore moments disappoints. He lingers too long over some deaths, makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter's head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary. Compared to the injury to the eye scene in Zombie or Christopher George chopping through the coffin in CotLD, Dr. Boyle's chopping through the door around his son's head feels like self-parody.Fulci's other films have incoherent plots , but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot (the dream-like nature of City of the Living Dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat) and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic. House by the Cemetery has neither thing working in its favor. It's not Hell of the Living Dead-level bad, but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting (especially Paolo Malco, who plays Dr. Boyle) and an interesting set-up almost make the flaws worse.Also, this version has a ""never before seen deleted scene"", but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack"	0
"In my 1-3-2007 review of the Harry Potter DVD series, I said about Alfonso Cuarn's direction of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban that ""perhaps Cuarn held back from doing his own thing"" because Chris Columbus had directed the previous Harry Potter releases and had oversight to Azkaban. Well the notion that Cuarn was holding back in his Potter directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing Children of Men.Cuarn can indeed make a great movie and could have made Azkaban great...but it was just good. Greatness clearly shines through when Cuarn is turned loose with ""his own"" film, and Children of Men is a good example. Children of Men is full of social and political themes as well as an abundance of messages of faith. And this is apparently what Cuarn does best (see 2001 directorial of Oscar nominated Y Tu Mam Tambin). In Children of Men almost 20 years have passed since the last human baby was born. The result? Chaos. Clearly the end of the World is near. Zombies might as well have taken over the Earth, and it was that zombie movie (you know, the good ones, like 28 Days Later [2002] or Dawn of the Dead [2004]) desperation that I was reminded of throughout Children of Men.Cuarn adapts P.D. James' 1992 novel to the big screen with several liberties, but keeps the message pretty much the same. The story is believably told, and the movie keeps an exciting pace all the way through. Clive Owen leads the cast, and this guy just gets better and better in every film that I see him in. He's supported by Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and a bunch of other actors that all turn in A-list performances.A fair amount of action. Suspense. A very well-told story....Everything that you need to keep you entertained. And, hey, did they actually keep the runtime to less than two hours for Children of Men? You don't get that too often anymore."	1
Let me preface this review by stating that if I had to do this 90-minute workout in its entirety I'd probably never reach for it -- it's just too long. But in its dvd format Karen Voight has thoughtfully provided a menu that has made this otherwise excellent program usable and doable. It's set up so that you can follow it in logical sections and, best of all, you can completely skip the squat sequence and just do the amazingly thorough floor workout, which is terrific for those like me who suffer from knee problems which prevent us from performing squats and lunges.I am able to successfully break this whole program down into *warmup/arms/abs/cooldown-stretch* Mondays and Thursdays, and *warmup/floor legs/cooldown-stretch* on Tuesdays and Fridays, and each intense workout is about 45 minutes.Music and clothing - especially the men's outfits! - are dated but I can get over it (though I'm sure there are others who cannot). Broken into shorter segments, I rate this 4.5 stars which I round up to 5.	1
These shows don't date. They are as fresh as they were over 30 years ago. These shows deserved all the Emmys they received. A must-see series. I'm glad they are finally releasing them. I would prefer more extra features though. More show commentary would be nice as well	1
This was purchased for my daughter for her 15th Birthday.  She is very deeply interested in Shakespeare and all his works but especially Romeo and Juliet.  I saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors.  I thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now.  Impressive that Mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today's teens and much of their other interests are definitely not Mom's thing. 	1
Hank Chinaski can't hold a job, can't hold a woman, can't control his alcoholism, and can't make a decent friend because he wallows with the dregs of society.  Chinaski is the lowest of the semi-functioning drunks, barely able to keep himself in seedy hotels and in liquor.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't hold much interest besides seedy bars and seedy people.  Chinaski's struggles as a writer are only touched upon and not delved into.  There's no budding poet or tragic talent underlying his alcoholism.  The closest he comes to poetics, IMHO, is where he tells his ex-boss openly that he really needs his last check typed out now because he needs to get drunk.'Factotum' is saved only by the acting and the ability of the costume designer to turn Matt Dillon (Hank), Lili Taylor (Jan), and Marisa Tormei (Laura) into sleazy characters who look rode hard and put out wet in each and every scene.  The script is stilted, without any highs or lows to it.  The movie isn't near as fatalistic as 'Leaving Las Vegas', or as hard hitting as 'Requiem For A Dream', and without any of the comedic relief from 'Spun'.  The closest comparison would be the jaw-stretching yawn-fest of 'Drunks'.Even if you love addiction movies like I do, or love Dillon or Tormei, that still isn't enough to recommend this movie.  If curiosity overcomes you as it did me, then rent the movie before buying it.  It's earned two stars for the acting alone.  Have a ball or something else to play with if you rent this, it's that boring.  	0
I hate to admit I actually own this thing on VHS.  And unless my mind is going more than usual, I have this cut of the movie too.Double (and more) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of DVD.  We get at least four issues of Terminator 2, but none of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  I personally am sick of it.Director's Cuts, Unrated Editions, and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet.  No wonder I've taken to borrowing nearly all my DVDs from the Public Library.No, you generally don't get them the day they come out.  But honestly, when was the last time you purchased a movie from Hollyweird that was worth keeping?  Don't do it	0
2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much happier than when I came in.This film is full of quick one-liners that deserve a laugh. The special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open. I have heard and read that people didn't appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races, but overall, I think the balance works well. Even thinking of the plot that we are left with, I really can't see another time when a race would even be appropriate.And as for people saying that this film is worse than the original, I would have to disagree...Why? Frankly, I have always been a firm believer than Vin Diesel is entirely overrated as an actor. (I mean, c'mon - Have you seen the Pacifier?) He's nothing more than a meat head who, while able to do pretty good fight scenes, should leave the dialogue to someone else. Yes, this film is for the younger crowd, and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place (take the boat jumping as an example), but there is no saying that an older person wouldn't enjoy it as well...The only thing that I will say is that you really shouldn't go into this film expecting an Oscar worthy performance, or else you will be disappointed. If you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is, however, you will thoroughly enjoy yourself	1
Well, I wrote the review about this set, and boy was I disappointed when I got it.  I see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters.  1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection.  The transfers are terrible and the sound is worse.  Come on guys, at least try to put some effort into it!!!  I got the set, watched it&lt; and traded it in at the local hock shop for something i could use.  What a waste of money!!	0
I ordered this item several months ago and its yet to arrive	0
What a disappointment! I absolutely loved The Black Pearl but was admittedly  nervous about a sequel. As it turned out, I had every reason to be. It whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original, major or minor, who seemed interesting. That they did but, unfortunately, the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say.Depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while Keira must have, somehow, pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie. Legolas, I mean, Orlando Bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along, sometimes good but more often, haphazardly. To my mind, the only real interesting addition was that of Davey Jones. Except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying (due to the tentacles 'n all), at least his was a unique addition to the movie. I do sort of object, however, to associating him with the Flying Dutchman legend. The two have nothing to do with each other, fantasy or not. And don't get me started on the cannibals!Any way, I think this movie merits the two y'ars I gave it. While considerably beneath that first movie, it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times, but it is most definitely not as good.And, as a final thought, the very last scene of the movie? Lose it entirely. It simply was unnecessary.	0
"Don't buy this. ""From the Grave"" is overdubbed b/w film without Bruce Lee in it. The other two aren't great either"	0
"This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war, anti-military, anti-American trash.  The ""show biz"" liberals, aided and abetted by their ideological cousins, the left-wing TV news moguls, have always sought to portray American soldiers in Viet Nam as baby-killing, drug-crazed monsters.  This movie is typical of that ilk. If you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war, buy the DVD of ""We Were Soldiers.""--a much better, and far more honest, film"	0
Dull, dull, dull.If I could have submitted a review and given ZERO stars I would have.Pointless	0
"Warner Herzog's ""Grizzly Man"" won the Director's Guild Award for best feature documentary, but the people who pass out Oscars apparently didn't agree. ""Grizzly Man"" was not among this year's nominees for Best Documentary.Many of Herzog's narrative films, such as ""Fitzcaraldo,"" deal with man's attempt to challenge the indifference of nature, so ""Grizzly Man"" is not a departure by any means. Herzog's heroes are often obsessed with accomplishing some mysterious, even bizarre, goal. Timothy Treadwell's fixation is on grizzly bears. ""I am one of them,"" he is heard to say. He survived in the wild, accompanied by a video camera, and, on at least one occasion, by a girlfriend., living among the most dangerous beasts in the world whom he apparently believed he was protecting. ""Animals rule,"" he said, fist defiantly pumping in the air. ""Timothy conquered."" Treadwell became a minor celebrity during his life, appearing once on David Letterman's CBS show, but he aspired to more. Before letting his love of animals consume him, he tried his luck in Hollywood. He got an agent, and auditioned for TV and movie roles. He was, he told his parents, second choice for the bartender role on ""Cheers"" which went to Woody Harrelson. Missing out on that opportunity left him ""crushed."" What really drove Treadwell? He reminds me of fey little Carson on ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,"" and as he openly mentions that it's easier to be gay than straight, I wonder if he was homosexual but unable to deal with his orientation, transferred his love of men to the roughest trade imaginable: grizzly bears. ""I like girls,"" he volunteers, but then he mentions various cruising places - truck stops, men's rooms - in such a way as to make me think he had personal experience haunting these kinds of homosexual hangouts. He was also an alcoholic. Were his wilderness adventures an escape from passions he was emotionally and psychologically unprepared to pursue? Those who are seen offering their remembrances of Treadwell never allude to his sexuality. They describe a man whose life is ruled by a naive, hippy, New Age approach to nature and who died as a result. The bears, to whom he gave names like ""Mr. Chocolate"" and ""Tabitha,"" need protection, he said, and he was their self-appointed caretaker. Others suggest that, despite his good intentions, he did more harm to the animals than he could have imagined. After Treadwell was eaten by a bear, the animal was shot and its remains became a feast for other forms of wildlife. Shooting a bear because he eats a man is comparable to shooting the customers at KFC for eating chicken. What is a bear supposed to do with a human who invades his turf? Treadwell was an intruder. One mans saysTreadwell made the mistake of thinking these were people in bear suits. But Treadwll knew these were animals. Trouble is, his knowledge of animals seemed to have been learned from Disney cartoons. The universe, director Herzog says, is ruled by hostility, chaos, and murder. Treadwell had a different philosophy. ""Isn't that sad?"" he squeals in his high-pitched girlish voice as he observes a bee who apparently expired while doing ""his pollen thing."" ""I love that bee,"" he says. Partially financed by the Discovery Channel, ""Grizzly Man"" is superficially a nature documentary about a man who loved wildlife so much that he felt at home among the bears and wolves more than he did his fellow humans. But it's also a portrait of a highly disturbed man who admits he was treated for manic depression but rejected medication to control the condition because, he admitted, he needed those soaring highs and crushing lows. He also needed to record his solitary life on video. We see him crying as he pets a wolf, laughing when his command that God make it rain seems to have been obeyed, and arrogantly blasting the humans whom he perceives as the enemy of the animals. What we do not see is his final encounter with the bear that ate him. Mercifully, the lens cap was on the camera when he was attacked. The camera was running, though, and Treadwell's screams, and the screams of his girlfriend, were recorded. Out of respect for his family, Herzog does not let the audience hear these recordings. Instead, we see him listening to the audio, and his reaction (telling one of Treadwell's friends that she must never listen to it, just as she must never see the coroner's photos of the aftermath of the attack), is possibly more effective than including the obviously horrific sounds in the film. ""I had no life,"" Treadwell said of his days before he began to frolic with ferocious beasts. ""Now I have a life."" That life is memorialized in Herzog's film. Brian W. Fairbank"	1
ah...um...well, my brother picked this up not too long ago, and , well...it sucks! it's the WORST of the whole series!i thought it would have to do with the mask Michael wears in the others, but not a FICKEN THING!!!!!!!!!!!!I gave it two stars because i liked the killing scene in the hospital, but then i took one because of how bad the rest was..	0
"First of all, the trailer was the best part of the movie & had me expecting a totally different story ... Second, the story I got turned out to be the ""Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" crossed with ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (the latter of which was even more boring than this hokey remake) & doesn't that therefore make ""Santa Clause 3"" SO cliche & SO done before?!Third, the kids in the audience seemed to enjoy it, but MAN was I bored! (& I actually enjoyed the original Santa Clause, so I can't blame the boredom factor on the fact that this is supposed to be a kids' movie ... )Fourth, I found the Christmas council to be extremely offensive (read: inappropriately pagan for a movie that is ostensibly about Christmas).*****WHOOP! WHOOP! WHOOP!*****SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!*****READ NO FARTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE!*****Fifth, I found Jack Frost's conversion to be ... zzzzzzzzzzzWhazzat? Oof. I must have dozed off for a minute. Sorry. Now what was I saying? Oh yeah. Poor, pitiful, evil Jack Frost.(ho hum)Wouldn't it have been much better to kill him off than convert him? I mean, come ON. Is the converted Jack Frost supposed to be an improvement? YUCKY. He's disgusting! I liked him much better as a villain. Better hair. Better duds. I say: just freeze him off next to a wooly mammoth & be done with him. Or bring him back in next year's sequel (because you know there's going to be one). For goodness' sake. Do we always have to embrace our inner icicle? (hurl)& sixth -- not only Jack -- but there was SO much about this movie that just didn't make sense! (yawn)Okay, I'm done with it. It's not even worth the time I took for it ..."	0
"One only needs to watch Ball of Fire to realize the depth of Barbara Stanwyck's incredible talent.  I'd match her up against ANY ACTRESS of her era or any other era!!  Here is a woman who can rip your heart out...even when she plays unlikeable characters because she always lets you see multi-dimensions of her characters.  Sugarpuss O'Shea is a perfect example of a bad girl with a soft heart who succumbs to the love a naive, good-looking gentleman.  But she also shows her love to the other professors.  1941 was Stanwyck's greatest Movie Year.....she made ""Meet John DOe"" and ""The Lady Eve"" in this year as well and she is excellent in all of them.  Stanwyck is the ONLY ACTRESS I CAN THINK OF who CAN DO ANYTHING!!  From drama to comedy, to musicals and of course westerns!!  While Stanwyck's singing is not on a par with her other talents (her singing was dubbed in Ball of Fire) she can still do a musical song and dance as is evidenced in her 1937 film (THIS IS MY AFFAIR where she plays a vaudeville entertainer).  Bette Davis could never play comedy and was too mannered with her rapid fire clipped speech and overacting.  SHe couldn't sing or dance (as Barbara did in Ball of FIre, Lady of Burlesque, This is My Affair and Banjo on My Knee).  Katharine Hepburn was a good actress but very unnerving also with her mannerisms, high patrician attitude and SHE COULD NEVER PLAY A PART IN A MUSICAL.  SHE COULDN'T SING).  Joan Crawford was a good actress in good movies but very few of her movies are good and she couldn't sing.  Doris Day was brilliant in comedy, musicals and drama but she would never be believable as a villainess or a heavy.  The same with Judy Garland.  Rare is the talent who could do it all.  I dare anyone to disagree with me that Stanwyck was the ONE who could do it all....Drama, Comedy, Westerns, Musicals!! Heroine or villainess! Stanwyck's work is always FIRST CLASS even when applied to material that is not.   She was simply the greatest and I'm sorry this review has turned into a tribute to Stanwyck but she should have won the Oscar in 1941 for Ball of Fire when she proved that she was the greatest actress in that wonderful era of actresses!!  The movie, Ball of Fire is great fun!!  From beginning to end Stanwyck and Cooper are unbeatable!!!  And the other professors are hilarious to watch as well!!  There is also a marvelous musical score and the production values are top notch! "	1
When I 1st watched Requiem From The Darkness I had high hopes for an anime show I heard that could actually by scary. To my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime. This show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people. The strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing. Also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered. This show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each/husband killing wife after wife/a man who enjoys murder/and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other. I recommend this show to no one and I believe Geneon has made a mistake licensing it. If you don't heed my review then you have wasted your money on a DVD not worth a penny (I wouldn't take it for free)	0
Before I rate the box set and the four movies I would like to give you a brief history of my life with these films. When I was really young I use to always ask my dad to rent Tremors and we would all set and whatch it. But when I got a bit older and I could understand things better I became afraid and was scared of Grabiods coming up from underneath are house and eating me. Anyways after about two years I got the guts to whatch Tremors 2: After shocks. And Afterwards I was agian afraid of Grabiods and now Shriekers attacking me. Finally after about ten years of not watching them, me and my buddy Travis got to talking about Tremors and he asked me what Grabiods where. So I dicided to draw him pictures of them and after a few days I ended up creating a Tremors comic. So after becoming so involved with Tremors again I decided to watch the first film again. And after it ended, I bought it off Amazon and a week later I bought the third movie and then another week after that I bought the second. I had literly gone a 180 from fearing Tremors so long ago to become a huge fan. And when the fourth finally came out I had my family, my friend Travis and his brother hooked. Now after being a huge fan and watching the four films over and over I can finally rate them. The original Tremors is by far the best; with it's all star cast and great story line. The second best would have to be Tremors 4: The Legend Begins because it stays more true to the first and it shows how it all began. Tremors 2: After shocks would be third best since it stared Earl and Gummer and Tremors 3: Back to Prefection would have to be the worst since it's story is weak, its short and it takes the evolution thing a bit far. Overall this is a great pack of all four Tremors movies and if I hadn't boughten all of them aready I would buy this Attack Pack. Ps. Tremors 5 script has been finished and if Tremors 4 sales enough they will make a fifth. And one more thing it would be awsome if Universal would release Tremors: The Series on DVD. 	1
"We must thank the director and salute Sigourney Weaver's beautiful performance: this movie gives us a rare insight into the lives and minds of the gentle, yet ferocious, giant mountains gorillas. It is also the amazing journey of an extroardinary woman who went to live by herself in a remote mountain of Rwanda, secluded from the world. She lost much of her sanity, as well as her life, in the process of saving the lives of a few hundred remaining gorillas. Without her work, who knows who could have saved them from savage murder and total extinction? Thanks to her work and dedication, a ""lost cause"" had been heard at last. The struggle for the survival of the ""Great Apes"" is not totally over though. One must hope that the abject poverty and the political unrest that still affect the region, as well as the illegal poaching and smuggling of goods and animals across borders - that happen with or without government officials' approval in each country involved - and the continuing deforestation and fauna's loss of habitat, can one day all come to an end so that the survival of these amazing creatures can be achieved. One must recognize the sacrifices and thank people like Diane Fossey, conservationists around the world, and the Rwandese people in particular, who have made it possible so far despite great internal economic and political pressures. All hope is not lost!"	1

"This sequel to a horror classic started out ok, but by the middle, none of it mattered anymore, I even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because I had to sit through scenes of a severed [...] and rat duking it out! The original ""ReAnimator"" is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline, but this sequel just stinks"	0
This is one of the best (if not THE best) pure screwball comedies of the 1930's. Next to the original Thin Man movie, Libeled Lady is my favorite Powell/Loy effort. This time, the magic chemistry of that oft-paired duo is enhanced by the box office-drawing talents of fellow mega-stars Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow. The first shot of the movie celebrates this happy collaboration as the four top-drawer actors merrily, confidently stride arm-in-arm toward the camera. The plot is convoluted. The Star has erroneously printed a story about heiress Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy), portraying her as a marriage wrecker. Connie immediately files a 5 million dollar libel suit. Star newspaper editor Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) counteracts by hiring on suave fellow newspaperman Bill Chandler (William Powell) to romance Connie and place her in a compromising position, thus negating the lawsuit. Haggerty convinces his harried, long-suffering fiancee Gladys Benton (Jean Harlow) to instead marry the bachelor Chandler as part of the scheme.  Things get really tricky when Gladys falls for Chandler and Chandler falls for Connie, who eventually falls for Chandler. And Haggerty? He pretty much spends the movie just seething. Yet everything ends fairly well, even if there's still lingering confusion as to who is exactly married to whom. Libeled Lady boasts mix-ups and complications galore and couples matching, cross-matching and mismatching. Sophisticated wit blends with full blown physical comedy. Delicious acting is laid in by four stars who, throughout their film careers, never ever lost their prime. Powell proves again his mastery of the confused double-take and, along with the wry, understated Myrna Loy, dominates the refined repartees. And representing the more lowbrow couple, Tracy supplies the blue collar bluster and Harlow the affronted looks. Walter Connolly as Connie's angling-loving father is simply wonderful. The intricate storyline is easy to follow, thanks to the clear helmsmanship of Jack Conway. With this cinematic venture, Hollywood certainly offered up to the viewing audience its most glamorous and most urbane of stars. I think it's brilliant stuff	1
   The caribou population is declining at an alarming rate and the Canadian government is concerned.  After a harrowing and kind of funny plane flight with tundra pilot Brian Dennehy government researcher Tyler is dropped in the frozen middle of nowhere.  It's a `kind of' funny plane flight because it's so well done.  Dennehy is a hung over, buckaroo bonzai type independent flyer.  His little prop plane, heavily laden with Tyler's (Charles Martin Smith) equipment, has a tough time both taking off and, later, staying afloat.  The in-flight repairs Dennehy makes had me on the edge of my seat - although the photography is the great strength of NEVER CRY WOLF, the acting - especially by Smith - and the editing are also nearly perfect. As harrowing as the plane ride is it's a pretty safe bet the plane will land (elsewise there'd be no movie) and Tyler will find survival, rather than research, is the pressing order of business. Tyler is there to locate a wild wolf pack, kill one or two of the pack members, and dissect them to discover if, as suspected, their stomachs contain an inordinate amount of healthy caribou meat.  Tyler, laden with crates of light bulbs and toilet paper, is materially and constitutionally unprepared for setting up a research station on his own.  Fortunately for him he'll be discovered, rescued, and befriended by two Inuits - the ancient Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq) and his adopted son, Mike (Samson Jonah.)  As Tyler notes in his voice-over narration, there are no orphans among the Inuit.  Ootek and Mike will arrive and disappear a few times, a wolf pack will be found, and Tyler will learn that man's relationship to the wolf is many times more complex than he imagined. I dislike most message movies.  They tend to distort characters and events, and beat you over the head until you accept their point of view.  NEVER CRY WOLF has a strong message about man and nature, but it's such an entertaining movie I didn't feel like I needed to join the Sierra Club to enjoy it.  The story lines are clear, and after the plane trip its plentiful humor is quiet and unforced.  Smith, who spends an awful lot of the movie alone, acting under his voice-over narration, is nuanced and convincing. Jorah and, especially, Ittimangnaq, are both good and both add a layer of authenticity to the film. And the photography is at times breathtaking.  NEVER CRY WOLF is a gem.	1
This movie has a good plot, great acting, and potrays a very convincing relationship between a hardened young man and a girl whose combonation of strength and purity touches his heart and redirects the course of his life. I did like that they seemed to really know and understand each other, but was dissapointed in the sexual inuendos, the profanity, the undermining of parental authority, and the lack of closure concerning Landon's journey to faith. It is evedent that this movie is directed to a less-than-mature-audience. I saw more bad in it than good, which is sad since it could have been such an outstanding movie	0
"""House of Mirth"" is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen.To be clear: I've seen movies like, oh, say, ""Schindler's List,"" or ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"" that treat tragic events, either in the macrocosm or the microcosm, that did not leave me depressed. Rather, they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think.""House of Mirth"" deals with tragic themes, including human society's ability to destroy its own, and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites. It wasn't, though, moving or thought provoking. I wasn't moved by Gillian Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor. I didn't believe Gillain Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor.Rather, I was bored. I kept wanting the film to go faster. It's a great irony; Edith Wharton's novels are real page turners. Quick, to the point. Hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality. ""House of Mirth"" has gorgeous clothing and sets. I didn't care about anybody onscreen, though. I didn't believe anybody onscreen.I felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda, and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces, as if to prove these points: people are hypocrites, see! People are insincere, see! If a person has any decency at all, that person is destroyed, see!I would tend to agree with all of the above points. So ... why do I need to watch this movie?Also, as a woman, who, as Lily Bart was meant to, has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that, I felt that this movie, no less than the Polite Society it depicts so brutally, betrayed Lily Bart.Lily Bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film. She all but participates in her own destruction. You want, just once, for her to show some initiative, some intelligence, some ability to create her own fate.The film denies her those abilities. In this crippling of Lily Bart, the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does.Movies like ""Gone with the Wind"" that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning, and occasionally gaining some power, imo, are much easier to watch. One might argue that such films are not realisitic. I don't know. Even we real-life Lily Barts have our resources, and our triumphs. And, again, watching Lily Bart in ""House of Mirth"" slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me. It was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine."	0
I'm pretty new to the Yoga experience. I started with a Kathy Smith DVD (hated it!) then I got a Yoga Zone Video -- the one for flexibility and toning and I found it to be very good. I then got another video -- Yoga Shakti which is excellent too and I was looking for another beginner video (the Yoga Shakti one has some advanced parts in it) so I bought Yoga Zone -- Introduction to Yoga. While some of the moves in it are on my first video, I still found this to be very good for beginners. Alan again teaches you the breathing technique -- which I often forget.  I noticed on another review someone complained about the slowness of it. Yes, it does move slow HOWEVER if you're a beginner and you're just learning the poses, the last thing you would want is for it to move fast. He takes the time to explain each pose and how it should feel when you're doing it. His voice is very soothing and puts me in a calm frame of mind.I honestly have to say that if I did NOT originally buy a yoga zone dvd, I more than likely would not have pursued the practice.  I think that Yoga Zone is what has gotten me more into it and wanting to practice more and learn more.I highly suggest this dvd to any beginner yoga-lite out there	1
"SPOILER ALERTThe ending of this 118-minute marvel seems an almost foregone conclusion. The bored billionaire did it. However, he and the sexy insurance detective play with each other until the audience is very, very hot. Pierce Brosnan, the billionaire, still sexist from his stint as James Bond, enjoys playing with the lady, Renee Russo. And she, as the tough but sexy Catherine Olds Banning, loses her heart to him, as much heart as such a sexpot character is allowed. In the process, she shows some very appealing nipples. The 1968 version, of which this is a remake, starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. In this version, to the socially irresponsible, self-absorbed 90s are ever present. We don't mind not having the suspense, we just yearn to see Brosnan and Russo ""get it on."" Dunaway appears as a psychiatrist who is trying to help the billionaire figure out why he is so socially irresponsible.Brosnan, as Thomas Crown, is bored, but open to being titillated by a beautiful woman, for as long as he is interested in her. For thrills, he steals priceless works of art from publicly-funded museums. The film makes it clear he can do so, under the noses of   security guards, police, and hundreds of innocent art-lovers. Russo's insurance company insured the painting, so she is looking to recover the irreplaceable, but impossible to fence Monet, and save her employer a bundle. What we have here is a film with clever dialog, rich and exotic sets, and loads of sexual tension. One wonders now, after Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other corporate heists, just whom Brosnan is cheating in order to support his high-tech heist brigade. How many of his employees are going to lose their pensions or health care benefits over this. He never really, you know, works. But I digress.Dennis Leary has a character role as the streetwise New York detective, who advises Russo's Banning. As we watch her slowly spiral out of control, risking her job and her reputation, we are kept mildly engaged in the question of whether Russo will fall for him, or Brosnan. Duh.The film moves back and forth from caper to cover-up. This can be confusing, but who cares? All we have to do is wait for their next move, the next gorgeous set, the next revealing love scene.The Thomas Crown Affair will keep both men and women interested, for all the usual reasons.It is a film worth watching, and a great date flick"	1
"this went up from one * in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles II, but otherwise its just a mess. the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble, but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes, who also gave us such film masterpieces as ""casino royale"" and ""chitty chitty bang bang"". richard harris is his usually unrestrained self, and thats not a compliment. now, i wont even go into the politics, which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero: as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas's paean to charles II in ""twenty years after"", but nowhere near as entertaining."	0
I love this old Paul Newman movie. The plot is terrific.  The characters and all the family personalities are very realistic. The story taking place down south is refreshing. Paul Newman is very sexy. I highly recommend seeing this movie if you are a Paul Newman fan. 	1
I have several Kathy Smith videos this is the absolute worse! I agree with some of the other reviewers that Kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated. Also, it seems like there a too many people in such a small space, the whole set looks very chaotic. I wonder if Kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself, it is very poor. All those crazy shuffle moves! Any other Kathy Smith workout will be better for you than this one.	0
I discarded the DVD after watching it. If you do not want to have the impression of witchcraft in your home don't buy this version of The Secret Garden.	0
In the third season Carter is finally a doctor, and all hell breaks loose for the characters.  The season especially deals with HIV/AIDS, violence in the workplace, unwanted pregnancy, etc... It won a lot of awards and is much fun to watch	1
I had high hopes for this movie, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton, how could I go wrong with this movie with a cast like that? Despite the cast this movie sinks under a terrible script. The film is often tedious and the characters never seemed very realistic to me. This was a poorly contrived and at times silly film. The tension never really builds even though the filmmakers try. Embarassing for all involved. I only give it two stars to be nice to the cast	0
"As I went through music school in the eary fifties I was confronted with ""Lenny"". Now at 72 I still have this pleasure. There are people in the NYP that are legendary as are the performances. This set will give me a huge amount of pleasure for what ever time I have left. It is a wonderful historical document but most of all a tribute-legacy that people will be wondering about many years in the future. Bob Allshouse from the Dana school of Music 1952-57 "	1
"The story of ""Alice in Wonderland"" was controversial from the moment that the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, wrote it.  Some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy.  Others consider Alice's journey as a trip into or through insanity.  For better or worse, Disney did capture many of these elements, and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film.  However, there are also those who loved the books and loved the film.  Normally I recommend Disney classis without reservations.  In the case of this movie, I will keep a couple of provisos.Alice is a young girl bored by her lessons.  As the length of the lessons grows, Alice soon drifts off, until a white rabbit passes by, muttering to himself that he is late.  Alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever.  Luckily for Alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent.Once at the bottom of the hole, Alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small.  However, there is a vial labeled ""drink me"" that Alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door.Alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation.  Indeed, Alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film.  Even the fundamental basis of Alice's journey through Wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies.  The ending of Alice's journey in particular is quite frightening, especially to younger children, embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares.  I remember seeing ""Alice in Wonderland"" as a child, and I remember I thought the ending was scary, and I was relieved when Alice was able to escape back to the normal world.Given that this film is well over fifty years old, I was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar, if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does.  The smoke did negatively affect Alice as it made her cough.  Perhaps there is an object lesson for children here.  While some consider many of the references to allude to drugs, I think that is a modern interpretation.  I think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use.  Remember that this story was first published in 1869.I believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by Disney.For all these provisos, this film is excellent.  It matches ""Fantasia"" in its surreal visions, and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb.  The animation is marvelous as well, readily illustrating the vision of Alice's journey.This movie is one of those rare Disney films that I am unable to recommend to all viewers.  Whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste.  If you enjoy animation oriented toward adults, then you may find this animation a treat.  If you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated, you may also find that you enjoy it.  I do recommend this movie for slightly older children, perhaps 8 and above, considering some of the disturbing images.  Good luck!"	1
"I have worked out to Denise Austin for several years because I think she gives a good workout BUT I CANNOT stand her way-too-perky personality. I was very disappointed in this dance workout. The setting is fun and colorful and the music is great, but as far as a workout...this dvd really stinks. I found some of the steps somewhat confusing (but I am NOT very coordinated). This workout was more of an ""indoor walk"" style workout (like Walk Away the Pounds w/ Leslie Sansone, etc.). If you are looking for a fun way to get up and move, this may be for you. BUT, this is not for anyone looking for a cardio intense workout"	0
Just show the real machines working, forget all the goofy narration that is annoying to adults and doesn't even hold my son's interest. He much prefers the Fred Levine series or the I Love CAT Machines series	0
"This 2-disc DVD set is a must have! Herein are contained 29 classic shorts spanning from 1930 to 1947, in the first of what will likely be a 2 volume collection. Included are some of Pluto's, and Disney's best cartoons, from the Oscar winning remake ""Lend a Paw,"" to the first appearance of Chip `N' Dale in ""Private Pluto."" Here is a rundown of what you get in this wonderful DVD set!Disc 1:The Chain Gang (1930): In this black and white Mickey Mouse short, Mickey is a prisoner in a chain gang who, after musical antics result in a riot, makes a break for it! Two bloodhounds, officially considered the first appearance of Pluto in a double role, are hot on his trail.On Ice (1935): In this early, color Mickey Mouse cartoon, the whole gang is enjoying a day on the ice, but Donald Duck's prank playing nature puts Pluto in the spotlight.Pluto's Quin-Puplets (1937): In this familiar classic, the first ""official"" Pluto short, we meet Pluto's family, as his mate, Fifi, leaves him to watch over their 5 puppies while she goes after some sausages. The outcome of which is a drunken Pluto and a fascinating paint catastrophe, resulting in some bizarre looking pups. Great short!Beach Picnic (1939): Donald Duck, the official star of this short, sets out to have a picnic on the beach with Pluto in tow, but the day is spoiled by a familiar flypaper routine and those pesky ants! The Duck and the dog are GREAT together!Bone Trouble (1940): Butch and Pluto battle it out over a bone here, the highlight of which is that famous funhouse mirror routine that saves the day! Great moments with Pluto in the hall of mirrors!Pluto's Playmate (1941): While Pluto is playing with a ball on the beach, a seal takes interest and becomes determined to make friends, despite the dog's resistance. Classic type of Pluto story, to be repeated again and again in future shorts.Canine Caddy (1941): Mickey heads out for a game of golf, but Pluto and a gopher louse things up!Lend a Paw (1941): This Oscar winning short about kindness to animals is pure Disney magic! Surprisingly, it's a remake of a black and white Mickey short! Great story about Pluto regretfully rescuing a drowning kitten that starts to take his place in Mickey's home. Pluto's devil and angel make their most memorable appearance in this one! Pluto, Junior (1942): Pluto's pup, Pluto Junior, can't seem to stay out of danger, even in his own backyard!The Army Mascot (1942): Pluto notices how well fed the local Army mascots are and decides to try to replace one of them. He foolishly chooses a grouchy goat! The Sleepwalker (1942): Pluto meets his second great cartoon love, Dina the Dachshund, in this classic short. However, he's more interested in hanging onto his bone than sparking romance. Too bad his sleepwalking is working against him.T-Bone For Two (1942): Pluto and Butch the bulldog clash again, in another epic battle over a bone.Pluto At the Zoo (1942): This excellent short is full of animal antics, as Pluto attempts to steal a bone from a lion's dish at the zoo. Love the gorilla scene!Disc 2:Pluto and the Armadillo (1943): On a trip to Brazil, Pluto's ball gets mixed up with a friendly Armadillo in a brief stop off between flights! Very cute short that features Mickey, too! Private Pluto (1943): Pluto is given orders to guard a cannon from suspected saboteurs. To our delight, those saboteurs are Chip `N' Dale in their first ever appearance! They're living in the gun and using it to crack and store their nut supply!Springtime For Pluto (1944): This rarely seen, very colorful Pluto short is a pure delight! It's rarities like this that are the gold nuggets of the Disney Treasures series! The Pan-like Spirit of Spring awakes Pluto to a bright new day, but his enjoyment is eventually smothered by the down-sides of nature.First Aiders (1944): Hooray, Pluto and Figaro! This short is one of those great Disney team-ups that features a star from Disney's ""Pinocchio,"" Figaro the cat! In this old fave of mine (I love Pluto and Figaro shorts), the boys battle it out while Minnie attempts to practice her first-aid skills on them.Dog Watch (1945): This is another fave of mine! Pluto is a Navy dog, and is given orders to keep intruders off the ship. A pesky rat causes trouble for him though, setting his sights on the ship's galley!Canine Casanova (1945): Pluto is madly in love with Dina, but can't get her to return the sentiment, until he rescues her from the local dog pound!The Legend of Coyote Rock (1945): Another old fave! Pluto is a sheepdog that has to fend off the legendary Bent Tail, the coyote!Canine Patrol (1945): In this short, Pluto works for the U.S. Coast Guard and takes his job a little too seriously, doing his best to keep a cute little turtle off the beach! Pluto's Kid Brother (1946): K.B. can't stay out of trouble, and he badly needs big bro Pluto's help when Butch tricks him into robbing a butcher shop!In Dutch (1946): Pluto is the local milk delivery dog in a little Dutch village. He and Dina get in trouble one day, when Pluto's wooing results in a false dike alarm sounding off. But, when the dike actually does spring a leak, it's Pluto and Dina who save the day!Squatter's Rights (1946): Chip `N' Dale are back to torment Pluto again, when Mickey and Pluto find them living in the stove of a cabin they are vacationing in! The Purloined Pup (1946): A wealthy puppy has been dognapped! It's up to police dog Pluto to locate the poor pup in the hideout of the number one suspect, Butch the bulldog!Pluto's Housewarming (1947): When Pluto is moving into a luxurious new doghouse, he discovers an unwanted houseguest in the form of that cute little turtle. He has bigger things to worry about, though, when Butch decides to move in too! From the Vault: Pantry Pirate (1940), separated due to ethnic stereotype content: Pluto does his best to sneak food from the kitchen without the housekeeper suspecting.From the Vault: A Gentleman's Gentleman (1941), separated due to ethnic stereotype content: One of Pluto's best cartoons, Pluto is the perfect dog to his master, Mickey, and takes every aspect of his role very seriously, including going to the corner to buy a paper.This is a fantastic collection of classic Disney cartoons, necessary for the Disney or Pluto fanatic! Extras include introductions from Leonard Maltin, Pluto 101 (an in-depth look into drawing and animating Pluto), The Life and Times of Pluto (a featurette about the pup himself), Pluto's Picture Book (a section of the Disneyland TV Show episode ""A Story of Dogs,"" that focuses on the career of Pluto), Pluto's Pal Fergy (a tribute to Norm Ferguson, the animator credited with developing Pluto), fantastic photo galleries (including Sunday comics, posters, backgrounds, etc...), a DVD booklet, a certificate of authenticity, and a lovely collectible poster art card. The packaging has gone a little cheaper than past releases (no more paper wraparounds, no more printing on the back of the tin), and I'm getting more and more annoyed with only getting half-episodes of the Disneyland TV series. Will it kill `em to give us complete eps? Otherwise, another outstanding Disney Treasures set! Can't wait for the next wave, and Pluto volume 2!"	1
I give it 3 stars for porn and -2 stars for a movie, therefore, collectively; you have your single star.  By all means, I suggest you get yourself some hardcore porn, beat off, and then watch a real movie.  Caligula blows literally and royally.  It is a little under 3 hours, which seemed like 3 days, and there is only about 20 minutes of decent film.  The small amount of story that is somewhat portrayed is simply stepped on by asinine porn.  The most triumphant scene in the movie is where the Roman soldiers attack the phallus-humbling papyrus stalks while flailing their genitals to and fro.  This movie is ridiculous.  In order to enjoy this, one must be completely perverted and dimwitted	0
Great movie and musical numbers courtesy of Quincy Jones and the wonderful cast.	1
this movie was awfull.  supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better, so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion	0
"This Minnesota-filmed movie reportedly has a cult-following, and the reason is not far to realize.  Joe Mazzello.  Joe is a 1990s and 21st century motion-picture phenomenon.  His presencein this movie is so REALISTIC and life-life that you forget thathe is acting.  He was pivotal in carrying this movie.  How so?May I add that Joe's axiom for acting is simply:  ""Just make it look Real!"" He achieved this to a stellar degree in ""The Cure,"" and also in the later fare: ""Simon Birch"".  Incredible acting, and I know good acting, for I was in a film in the early 1990s and also wrote the musicalscore for it.  No, I am not going to name-drop.The Cure juxtaposes 2 boys of different social/geographical/educational genres together and in this movie a friendship is unexpectedlyforged and may I add that it is a friendship of rare mutual-concern, honest caring, and warm affection. No matter how many times I watch it, tears always come to my eyes in the final 20 minutes of this film.  Joe is the best!"	1
"Take some talented actors and put them in an age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more of the same.  Really, is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids?  They deserve better.The key point of this movie is that lying is bad.  Good point.  A device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks.  Also good.   Unfortunately, the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible (even kids will have a hard time believing a man can't tell he's been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror), and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion, the entire thing falls flat.Making films for children is a fine thing.  They shouldn't be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children, however.  Quite honestly, I'd rather have a kid watch something like ""Good Will Hunting"" before this.Don't waste your children's time with this film.  Read them a book ... a good book ... instead"	0
I stumbled across this movie on cable a couple of years ago, having nothing better to do I watched it. My first impression was that it would be just another stoner movie were nothing really happens. I was suprised though because not only does it have a plot it has a interesting plot. You don't have to be stoned, or even a stoner to enjoy this movie. One reveiwer said somthing along the lines of it looking like grade school kids made it. Well it is true it was an independent film made on the cheep but think it actualy adds something to the over all feel of the film, like your actualy there, scrapping through life with the characters. I guess I can understand why some people wouldnt get this movie, not enough bells and whisels, but if your up for something differnt give it a try. by the way, the movie was based on a book of the same name, also very good and differnt	1

"I thank the creators of this film which took me back to the days of growing up in Detroit.  All the time time I was learning every new Motown song and every new dance step to go with the newest hits, I had no knowledge of the Funk Brothers. I grew up on Detroit's ""North End"" and a lot of the Motown stars came from this area. I connected to the film immediately when it opened to snow-covered English tudor homes on Detroit's Northwest side. The film has wonderful themes: fame, success, heartbreak, the beauty of friendship among musicians, failure to be recognized, recognition much too late, and attempts of redemption, if not apology. I think the whole city of Detroit, or at least my part of it, was heartbroken with the news that Motown was moving to Los Angeles. In the film the musicians are given their due, a la their Cubano brothers and sisters in ""Buena Vista Social Club."	1
Amazon should send all of these 25th Anniversary DVD's back to UNI, the faulty product locks up after about 1 1/2 hours on both my Panasonic and Sony DVD decks! I see this problem also exists in the wide screen version from the reviews of that product.Simply put - DON'T BUY THIS LOUSY UNIVERSAL PRODUCT!!!	0
This movie has been done over and over again, with different actors and by different directors, but the plot is stale and has gotten extremely boring.  Don't bother with another cookie cutter movie of this kind.... buy something original or save your money	0
This is a terrible movie. When it came out in 1956 it was a box office bomb even though both stars were at the height of their powers. Time had only added to it's mediocrity	0
I thought that this was Adam Sandler's best movie he has made.That he played man who's a slacker that he trys to impress his girlfriend by adopting a cute 5-year-old boy(played by Dylan & Cole Sprouse).I think of how the movie should've ended real good is for Sonny to have Legal Custody of Jullian.I laugh out loud when I see this movie!!!	1
After reading a couple of other reviews about the &quot;quality&quot; of transfer on this dvd, I decided I wanted this in my collection. What I THOUGHT would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality, I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED.THE QUALITY OF TRANSFER OF THE PICTURE IS HORRIBLE!!! A great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality. Non anamorphic, deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered. Picture tones are very, very bad, along with what little color that is desplayed. Almost a black &amp; white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on. Even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv, it still was so dark it almost wasn't worth continue watching.The ONLY things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and &quot;suppossedly&quot; in Dolby Digital EX. The beginning Dolby intoduction was deffinatly in Dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn't distributeand Dolby sounds that I could make out on my theatre sound system. Sounded like mono to me.Thsi dvd reproduction stinks and I suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this &quot;Goodtimes Video&quot; version untill it is put on dvd correctly. Why they botherd is beyond me. Because I wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen, I am taping it on to VHS for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow. I suppsoe I'll have to be content that I got the widscreen version on VHS for now untill they re-release it on dvd with better quality, or they show it on tv in widescreen which I highly doubt. Heck, even TAPING IT OFF TV YOU'D GET A BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN THIS DVD	0
There are two story lines here, one an unqualified celebration of the state of girls' prep sports after a generation of Title IX's beneficial impact, and another the very qualified consideration of the state of some individual girls' athletic lives after a generation of Title IX's less beneficial side-effects.  Heartbreak, fury, exultation are the viewer's rewards.  Only quibble is that the climactic game was documented in too abbreviated a manner	1
"These films used to be on TV all the time. I was amazed at how clever the plots were. I didn't remember some of them. ""Weird Woman"" is my favorite ""B-film"" and I'm always recommending it to people. Movies used to be so entertaining ! It's great to have this collection available to film fans. We can overlook Chaney's stiffness, as the rest of the cast really compensates for it"	1
"Even though I am not a Streisand fan, I was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was.  The plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for Streisand's character, making her attractive - no, irresistible - to the main male character.  The problem is, she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover!  Somebody (probably Streisand) thinks that highlighted hair, a tight black cocktail dress, and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress, casual clothes, and everyday looks are disgusting. BAAAAAAMP!  (That's the fallacy alarm going off:  men, in my experience, don't care much about clothes and makeup.) There was a lot of emphasis placed on the Streisand character's losing weight by riding an exercise bike, but she looked exactly the same afterward - no detectable weight difference!Yet truly, the low point of the movie is the scene in which Streisand, discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother (played by Lauren Bacall), blubbers, ""Wazz I a pretty baby?  WAZZ I A PRETTY BABYYYYEEEE?""  In that one scene, Streisand's neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed.  The whole movie is about this issue, and it's amazing that an entire cast, crew, and production company would devote themselves to B.S.'s emotional issues like that.I really think that the ""Funny Girl"" phenomenon somehow ruined Streisand's thought processes.  The media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light-years away from the stereotyped, Northern European beauty standard of the time (think Grace Kelly; think Ingrid Bergman.....).  I recall reading about how her glowing complexion, thick hair, and good figure (as well as her energy and voice) carried her through despite her looks:  long nose, large lips, slanted eyes.  Myself, I think she looks like an Egyptian princess or similar; but she certainly doesn't look like Grace Kelly.....So why can't she accept this?  The majority of us women, whatever our race, color, or bone-structure, learn to live with and love who we are.....at least I hope we do!  This movie is not about that.  This movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable.  Maybe I should've given it only one star"	0
"This review refers to ""Excalibur""(DVD-Region 2)   In days of old, with knights so bold, and fair maidens glittering all in gold, lays the legend of King Arthur, Camelot, and the powerful, mystical sword known as ""Excalibur"". John Boorman's beautiful artistic film (adopted from Sir Arthur Mallory's ""Le Morte D'Arthur""),will captivate you and take you away to another time and place. From the birth of Arthur, Merlin taking him away for 20 years, Arthur drawing ""Excalibur"" from the stone, the emergence of Camelot,the magical powers of Merlin and the evil Morgana, to Arthur's demise and being taken off to Avalon, the beauty of this film and this story will have you under a spell.   The European cast and the exquisite location shoots in the country side of Ireland add a sense of authenticity to the flavor of this film. King Arthur, The Knights of the Round Table,Sir Lancelot, Guinevere, Merlin, Morgana, Sir Gawain, Percival, Uther, they're all very much part of the story, and the cast is tremendous. Nigel Terry is the good and noble King Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere, who loved their King but also each other are played by Nicholas Clay and Cherie Lunghi. You'll see stellar performances by a young Gabriel Bryne(in his first feature film), Patrick Stewart, and Liam Neeson. Helen Mirren is excellent as the evil Morgana, and the always wonderful Nicol Williamson is the magical mystical Merlin   This edition is for viewers with DVD players compatible with Region 2(Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East, including Egypt ).Some players are multi-regional, so check your manual.   Parents...although a wonderful tale of knights and fair ladies, this is NOT one for younger viewers. The battle scenes are violent and a bit graphic and there are also some sexual situations. ""First Knight"" with Richard Gere and Sean Connery, although not quite as true to the legend, is rated PG-13, is quite an entertaining film, and may be more suitable for family viewing(there is some violence).   A beautiful story and film. Enjoy....Lauri"	1
"All of us have a dark side.  Unfortunately AUTO FOCUS focuses on this small subset of actor Bob Crane's life and expands it out of proportion.  In doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of Crane's life and career as window dressing.  Even the screenplay is, at best, an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of Bob Crane and John H. Carpernter  -- since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice-accused murder suspect.In viewing this film I knew that it would involve some of Crane's extracurricular activities.  My interest in the film was as a HOGAN'S HEROES fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful six-year series.  Bob Crane's professional credits alone would make for a good film.  AUTO FOCUS unfortunately revolves around Crane's so-called ""secret life"" and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd.Facts are facts and there are established truths about Bob Crane's private life.  AUTO FOCUS, however, should be approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery store scandal magazine.  You are better off spending your time and money buying the DVD releases of the HOGAN'S HEROES television series."	0
"This movie made no sense to me whatsoever. it wasn't really funny and it wasn't scary. the only thing that i got was that he killed Zombies or ""Returners"" as he called theme. and was upssed with one. i have to admit the female lead in the film was hot. but that was the only good thing in the film. it was also boring. but if you are into forgin fright films this is the movie for you"	0
This is the worst ripoff of a major literary work I have ever seen. It takes colossal gall (to say nothing of immense bad taste) to take the bare bones of a Dostoevsky novella & tack on every possible bodice-ripper cliche in movies & then try to interweave Dostoevsky's own personal travails as narrative interstices. All done with no flair for nor flavor of the original. The acting is strictly mid-20th century nyah-ha-ha Masterpiece Theater while the casting is about as suitable as Ray Winstone in his infamous Henry VIII turn.I got this just to see the great Luise Rainer. Now I will dispatch this disk to the dustbin where it will surely be outclassed	0
Terms of Endearment captivates me with the believable relationship of mother and daughter as brilliantly portrayed by Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger.  It covers approximately 30 years of the turbulent yet loving relationship between mom Aurora and daughter Emma.  They have their differences; yet the love between them is always so obvious.  It's also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other, even their sex lives.  I've seen this movie several times, and everytime I cry at the end.  In spite of the death, the movie ends on a positive note, giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay.  The budding relationship between Aurora and her neighbor (also brilliantly portrayed by Jack Nicholson) creates a plot-within-a-plot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between Emma and her husband and children.  The most interesting aspect is that Emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her, when she has been cheating on him as well.  Somehow though we sympathize with Emma and her gentle lover (played by the very talented John Lithgow).  We feel like they belong together and somehow their relationship doesn't seem wrong.If you are in the mood for a movie that is entertaining and gut-wrenching at the same time, this is a perfect choice	1
The story here dosen't matter. The main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending. Scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction, meth. Quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless. Roberts is so gay you want to smack his face. he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity. Rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius, a role he plays better than anyone today in film. BR	0
It has been a couple years since I've seen this, and I can still honestly say that it's like watching a Andy Warhol movie of Salvor Dail puking.  A kind of swirly colorful mess, with Brendan Fraser and Bridget Fonda stuck in the ooze of ick, and can't escape it's yuck of a screenplay...On a positive note, Jim Carrey isn't in it. Other then that, nothing can redeem Henry Selick, Kaja Blackley, and Sam Hamm for this putrid monstrosity, and I mean that from the bottm of my heart	0
I recently had a baby boy, and felt a &quot;little&quot; out of shape after having him(HA!)I did a search on amazon and found this video. I got it in 3 days, and began right away. My son works out with me every day, and I couldn't be happier! We both have fun doing the exercises which work my whole body, and I use him for the weights!I am also learning about my baby's development from the video. It's educational and rewarding. Thanks MBBB	1
"This movie ended where Tyrese Gibson and Meagan Good meet up again in Mexico.  But heck, they are both fugitives hiding from the law.  How is this a proper happy ending?  Although, I will admit, Meagan Good is a fine looking young lady.  Just knowing that she was in this film, got me to want to watch it.However, I don't understand the appeal of these kinds of films.  Violent ""black/gangsta"" films with lots of foul language, gun-play, and just bad tempered attitudes.  Even that music sounds like it would stir up hatred and provoke violence and harm to anyone just passing by.  I wish people would get rid of that ""What are you looking at?"" mentality that just seems to encourage fear to innocent people just passing by.My wife is asian, and her older sister married an Hispanic guy.  We go to their house every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Nothing makes my holidays more depressing than to have to go over to his house and have to watch these violent ""gangsta"" movies, with his kids.   I'm trying to teach my kids to not have any prejudices of other races, but these kinds of films make the black race look bad. There wasn't very many positive messages in this movie. And if black people are so offended by the use of the ""N"" word, then why do they keep using it themselves?   If it's such an offensive term, then they need to stop using it themselves.  These kinds of movies promote and glorify the ugly side of being black in the ""big city"".  Black people need to do more movies with more ""positive"" themes.  We gotta work together if we're going to diminish our black and white prejudices.  I wish my brother-in-law would stop having this kind of crap on his TV when I have my children over.   It's hard to talk to him about it, especially when he thinks there is nothing wrong with our kids watching these kinds of films.  What's more, it's hard to reason with someone that has to use the ""F"" word in every sentence.I'm really beginning to struggle with my prejudices within my own family."	0
The direction of this film is excellent.  I love all the characters and the way they interact.  The storyline is very important also.  It's about religious beliefs and neighbors that interact with each other.  It's a well-paced and interesting story that's not like anything else I've ever seen.	1
"I'll get to the plot of ""The Gang's All Here"" in a minute, because theplot isn't the most memorable part of this movie. The most memorable part is the bananas.About 20 minutes into the movie, a towering hat of Technicolor fruitappears on the screen, followed by its owner--""Brazilian bombshell"" Carmen Miranda. She proceeds to do a number called ""The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat,"" accompanied by chorus girls who bear bananas. Six-foot-tall bananas that continuously droop and sprout until number's end, when the chorus girls, worn out by the burden of this mutated fruit, lay down for a long siesta on a stage dressed up like an island.There's a reason this number occurs so early on: It takes you the rest of the movie to convince yourself you actually saw this in a 1943 movie.But then, this is Busby Berkeley, a director who staged his musical numbers as though he was declaring war. And next to kitsch, war is pretty much the motivator here.The wafer-thin story involves Andy (James Ellison), a soldier who woos and wins Edie (Alice Faye), a canteen dancer, the nightbefore Andy goes off to World War Two. In what seems an instant, Andy gets decorated and returned home to a victory party thrown by the family of Andy's childhood sweetheart and fiancee--who, unfortunately for Edie, is not Edie.  Will the heartbreak be resolved? Do you really care? The plot ismostly an excuse for some snappy repartee between major '40sstars (in particular, Eugene Pallette and Edward Everett Horton arehilarious), and the kind of musical numbers that seem to drop outof thin air. (In a couple of scenes, Benny Goodman and hisorchestra stroll by and do some songs just for the heck ofit.)""The Gang's All Here"" is really a 1943 time capsule, but aneye-popping rouser of one. They don't make 'em like this anymore.They didn't make 'em much like this back then, either"	1
I loved the book and I feel that this movie did it justice.  The actresses are new favorites of mine, and I feel they really captured the spirit of the characters.  The movie really does a fantastic job of transporting viewers to 19th century England just as the book does.  I would definately recommend this movie and the book.	1
"I expected so much more from this movie, I guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors (Jolie & Washington) and also had the always on point Queen Latifah as well.  I watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie, but I walked away bitter with shattered expectations.  First off I will say that Latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason I smiled on occasion during this movie experience.  Washington and Jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable (especially Washington who really strained in this role) that I was constantly asking myself ""do I really like these two?"" and I had to remind myself of movies like 'Gia' and 'Training Day' to answer with a resounding ""YES!""The film follows a rookie cop (Jolie) as she helps a quadriplegic ex-cop Lincoln (Washington) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called 'The Bone Collector'.  The ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer, while not who you'd pinpoint, is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever.  It's like ""oh so he/she did it...interesting""...and I'm bored.  I'd skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling"	0
I bought this video based on the reviews and was so disappointed that I never got past the first 20 minutes.  I am not a prude, but to use the f word in every sentene as an adjective, verb and however else it may be used was a complete turnoff.  I put the video in my recycle box.  Maybe it had some substance, but I could not get past the first 20 minute	0
Timeless classic movie. 2 of the songs are frequently re-done by various artist	1
there's nothing you can tell clearly about this movie, because from the very beginning to the end, i've just heard lota f words; f....this, f....that, typical stupid stereotyped mafia talks. and i swear to god when i watched this pathetic movie and thought that if mafia could be this stupid, and if they could just use that fxxx word in every sentence they talked, and if they thought that by using this fxxx word once they open their mouth to talk and used this f word to show their smartness and toughness, or if they thought by simply using this big F word and they could kill thy kingdom come, then america might not look like what we're seeing now. maybe the mafia could just use this big word to kill all the terrorists in the world, maybe they could just use it to solve all the problems and guess what? they're just using that word to kill each other. or is this just what hollywood think that all the mafia mob guys could walk the walk easier by simply using this big F word to talk the talk? i don't have any clue, man	0

Quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time. Clive Owen is really cool, but not in this movie. Angelina Jolie's polital agenda totally fueled this film. What a waste of time	0
The Alpha version of Postal Inspector is of very poor video quality.  Otherwise, it may have been an interesting mishmash in what was Bela's last film under his original Universal contract.  The stock footage of the flood is spectacular	0

"Wow!!! I bought this set a couple of months ago and I've been watching each episode little by little, and enjoying each one of them a lot!!! It's interesting to watch Captain Scarlet again, thirty-something years after the last time I watched it back in the late 60s (when I was 7 or 8 years old)!I was (and still am) a huge fan of the ""Thunderbirds"" and became quite delighted when this new series from Gerry Anderson first appeared on TV back in the 60s! The quality of Captain Scarlet's special effects obviously got better since the Thunderbirds, and it really makes a huge difference (as far as realism is concerned) to have the marionettes more realistically proportioned! So much so, that there are times when you can almost forget that they are marionettes!The production still looks fabulous after all these years! The design of vehicles, machines, personal equipment, weapons, buildings, etc. is quite enjoyable, interesting and sometimes even surprising! The ""Angels"" (both airplanes and pilots) still manage to look amazingly sharp and contemporary!!! Perhaps only the automobiles give you a hint of the series real age, for they look quite dated indeed! However, now it seems a bit funny to see 1965 Chrysler and Ford lookalikes among the futuristic modernism of the series!Thirty-something years later, most of the episodes plots seem a bit shallow, almost stupid! But one has to remember that this series was meant for children! So, once you remember this you'll be ready to have a great time watching Captain Scarlet and his fellow Spectrum buddies fight the evil Mysterons (led by the sinister looking Captain Black), just as you did when you were still a child!Spectrum is green!!!...Enjoy it!!"	1
"Four stars seem a little generous. The film is certainly memorable, and certainly different. There are a lot of odd things going on here. The oddest is why the central character, Mark Lewis, is so obviously a blond, blue-eyed German. Very strange, this. Is there some weird subterranean comment about the sickness of Hitler's Germany, and how we ought to feel sorry for the perpetrators of his crimes, because of their blighted childhoods? Much of the rest of the symbolism is very heavy-handed, however, as other reviewers have pointed out. It is consistently perverse. The director of the film within the film: ""The Walls are Closing In"", is played by an actor who was in point of fact virtually blind. He had a bit part in several James Bond films. Is there some message here? Peeping Tom's father, the heartless psychologist, was played by Powell himself. What is this telling us?  Is part of the message meant to be that the camera kills? It doesn't hang together somehow. What's the meaning of the model with half a hideous face? Why is the would-be girl-friend's alcoholic mother blind? Why is the only presence with real star quality, Moira Shearer, playing a stand-in? Much of the premise of the film seems promising, but it is clumsily written, and directed with a leaden hand. In fact, what many of the Powell-Pressburger films seem to lack is any real sense of pace or excitement. It's all a bit tired, and slow. There is nausea, but no shock or thrill. Loco, perhaps, but Psycho, it isn't."	1
It's a funny concept to begin with, and Stiller is hilarious. Then you throw in Rip Torn (probably the best film Judas, among his many credits over the years), and these cameos that are out of control (Shatner, Armstrong, Norris) and you've got a comic classic.	1

This a dreadful example of what Jayne was reduced to play in to feed her children and compensate for the lack of earnings of her deadbeat-husbands/lovers.The only reason to watch it would be because Mamie Van Doren was also in it.But be aware (and i read that in a biography about Jayne) that in their contracts was specified that they would NOT appear together in ANY scene whatsoever.So you see them SEPARATELY in different scenes.Also be aware that if you blink,you will not see either of the 2 blonde beauties.Conclusion:Get this film for a member of your family who is nostalgic for the ways of the ''Ol' South',or someone with a white hood showing his eyes onl	0
sorry, can't finish this garbage movie. is this girl retarded  or what? watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all. how and why the garbage collecting, turned cow feeder young guy, would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer? there's no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath. the girl didn't look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character. the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless. what? life was too boring then what? started becoming natural born killer? give me a break. bone chilling? you can always say that again, but won't make me care a bit more.	0
I agree that this is technically an excellent film.  But it is also unrelentingly grim and without a payoff of any kind.  Given the lowlifes who inhabit this story its hard not to sympathize a bit with Richard Widmark's character.  His enthusiasm is as boundless as his optimism.  But in the end he doesn't just lose; he is literally thrown away as garbage.  And then there is the wrestling scene which was so gruesome it was hard to take.  All in all, I was left with the question, what is the point?The commentary leaves a lot to be desired as well.  Its basicly a description of what you're watching, while you're watching it.I see everyone regards this as a masterpiece so I'll watch it again but as film noir goes there is something very unsatisfying about this movie. 	0
Of course Dead Alive was the better movie.  But I think the comparisons to the Peter Jackson masterpiece are appropriate, due to the fact that there is a high body count, lots of over-the-top splattery deaths, and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers, some as zombie lunch.  Apparently there was some footage  cut out for this release.  I'm not sure if that was gore footage or not, but I would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence.  There is even some non-gore &quot;grossout&quot; humor (vomit-related, etc.) that reminded me of Bad Taste as well as Dead Alive.  Sorry to run the Peter Jackson comparison into the ground, but again the influence is unquestionable.  Don't expect the FX quality of Dead Alive though, this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly.  I don't know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print/transfer, but it's a minor distraction.  They did a great job with a relatively small budget.  I echo the other reviewers who would like to see Ittenbach's other films on US (hopefully uncut) DVD release--I've heard Burning Moon is especially crazy	1
"Here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made! I couldn't believe what I was watching! Moreover,I am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating. What is going on? Is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about? Am I naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain? Where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work,hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema's most tedious and overratedsleep inducing actor Ralph Fiennes?How I long for the good old days when we had great movies with great actors from great writers and great directors and which achieved what they set out to do - entertain.Sadly with the emergence of such a travesty as ""The Constant Gardener"" it appears that we unfortunate ""real"" film lovers are in for a dismal viewing future."	0
"""All men can do anything, if they will"" seems to be the final statement of this captivating picture, carefully directed by Agnieszka Holland, one of the major female directors in the world.This absorbing drama turns around the lives and times of three children who will meet each one another and exchange livings and fortunate encounters. On one hand, our little girl will know the world is not turning around her; and her initial solitude will be rewarded when she found out a hiddden that will make her dreams come true, and finally she will the one in order to impluse and bring back her cousin to the life.A triumph of the cinema and definitively one of my top twenty best films of the Nineties."	1
"Season 1 of Veronica Mars took me by surprise, and I really enjoyed the ride.   The second season, however, doesn't live up to the quality of the first.  Instead of one large mystery, in season two viewers are treated to several smaller mysteries to solve.  There's nothing wrong with that approach, but it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved, another would pop right up without any resolution for the first.  Many episodes ended with my friends and I turning to one another and asking, ""Is that it?  Where's the rest of it?""  This happened quite a bunch, with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps the most jarring.  Are we really supposed to believe someone as determined as Veronica would just pick up and call it quits because she gets a weird slap on the wrist?  That's totally out of character, yet we never see that family, the abused girl, or hear about the incident again.     That type of confusion and weird plot points kept popping up.  The ""major"" villain of the season comes out of left field to be the murderer, and his motivation for murder ends up being really weak and unbelievable.    Because of the all the loose ends, go-nowhere plots, and the surprise villain who was probably a surprise to the writers up until deadline, I'm giving Season 2 a 2 star rating.  Season 2 of Veronica Mars still has some funny dialogue, and some clever episodes, but it doesn't deserve all the 4 and 5 star reviews I've seen.  I'll continue to watch, however, as Veronica Mars has a lot of promise.  Hopefully the producers can get things in gear for season 3"	0

I thought... what the heck, I'll watch it.  So I did.  I loved it.  I was SO surprised none of the critics liked it.  It was well made and the characters are all rather believable.  I was surprised at how many bad reviews it got.  I thought it was rather good	1
This movie has more magic than a wand. This movie is a story about having faith in your beliefs. Young Jessica is so sure that this reindeer is Prancer she is willing to go to extremes to help save her friend. Sam Elliot plays a tough dad who wants to have faith in his only daughter but is scared of losing her and his farm. This a wonderful classic for the young and old.	1
"At 23 years of age, I can truly say that I have been a lifetime fan of Sesame Street. Watching the 3-DVD set of Sesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1 has been both nostalgic and enlightening. Because I was born practically a decade after most of the material on this set originally aired, I expected most of the content to be new to me (I was barely a year old when Mr. Hooper's death was explained to the world), but that was not the case. Many of the short films and interstitials were familiar (and not just because I used to watch Sesame Unpaved on Noggin) to me as a viewer from the mid-1980s, and I think that just underscores the quality the show has exhibited from the beginning. Sesame Street truly revolutionized children's programming, not just because it was educational, but because it was (and remains) entertaining, not pandering. I'll admit, seeing Gordon with an afro, Orange Oscar and the first few tries at Big Bird's head still freak me out a bit (as they did when I saw them on Noggin several years back), but the show itself is just as good as I ever remembered, something that cannot be said for most nostalgia entertainment (like Transformers or He-Man or JEM).The set contains five full episodes from the first five seasons, and 54 (the liner notes are incorrect, they should have asked Count for help) bonus clips. The set also includes the 25 minute pitch-film that was made before the series originally aired, explaining Sesame Street's message and motive. Although the episodes have a disclaimer that it is not necessarily intended for today's pre-school children, I believe they would probably enjoy ""classic"" Street even more than the current lineup of shows. The fact that today's pre-schoolers may be more advanced than the Sesame Street of yore can really be attributed to Sesame Street itself, and that's pretty cool. Still, I personally appreciate that the aim of the set is at adults, because so many of us associate our childhood with Sesame Street. A booklet is included that gives a brief overview of the series from the first five years and I found it informative. According to Muppet Central, a few sketches were altered or removed for music copyright issues (one with Stevie Wonder, one with Rogers & Hammerstein), but because I never saw the originals, I found nothing amiss. What astounded me more than anything was that at the end of the first five years, more than 600 episodes of the show had been produced. No wonder they can't release full seasons! Although the full-length episodes are great, my favorite part are the additional sketches from each respective season. Seeing Kermit sing ""Bein' Green"" in its original form, the ""Bread, Milk and Butter"" cartoon and the ""In in the Sky with Diamonds"" parody is a real treat.The picture quality is great -- especially considering the program's age (and the fact that it was one of the first programs to be recorded on video, although film was used for most of the interstitials) -- I doubt the show ever looked as good as it looks right now. The sound quality is good too -- mono of course -- but clear and crisp.Overall, I highly recommend this set for anyone who loves or loved Sesame Street. For those who were born after these episodes aired (like me), looking back at the beginning is really special. It is clear that everyone involved had a true love for teaching and interacting with children and taking television to another level"	1

"  Is there anything more American then apple pie, baseball or a good Rock Hudson/Doris Day Film? It's always been such a treat to curl up with them and the third essential player, Tony Randall. Rock is always doing something to infuriate Doris. He's her worst nightmare. And what's more, he pretends to be someone else that Doris falls for head over heals until the gig is up. Then she's out for revenge, but love always wins out. Ahhhh such feel good, laugh out loud stuff. So in this one from 1961 ""Lover Come Back"", Madison Ave is the setting. Advertising is the game of Carol Templeton and rival Jerry Webster. But Jerry is such a cad and a playboy. He steals big clients right from under her by wining and dining them, throwing raucous parties and getting the girl for them. Carol on the other hand, does things a little different. She's virtuous and business like. When he trumps her cards once too often, she plans to get a little underhanded herself. Trying to win over the scientist that is going to invent a new product for our guy Rock, Doris, who has never met Webster(as is always the case), mistakes him for...you guessed it..the shy, retiring, needy nerdy scientist. Jerry, in true form goes along with it, and tries to woo Carol into his bed. And the fun continues... Doris is marvelous. Watch her face. So many different emotions she goes through. From being Exasperated, to being in love, she does it all. She's simply a joy. Rock matches her perfectly with his pretenses, and has a way with the dialogue that just says Rock!  As mentioned Tony Randall is always the third part to the equation that makes these films such classic fun. Here he is the President of the ad firm and Jerry's boss, but hasn't a clue as to what's going on. He does this quite well.Meanwhile, the fun doesn't end with Doris and Rock. The race to make a new product, VIP! is causing quite a few explosions and when the product is finally ready for testing...well you just have to see for yourself!The rest of the cast is quite a roll call. Ann B Davis, Delbert Mann, Donna Douglas(the beautiful Ellie Mae Clampett), Edie Adams, Jack Albertson, Jack Oakie, Joe Flynn, Richard Deacon,wow... the list goes on.The transfer to DVD looks great. Picture clear, colors good.The film is presented in Anamorphic widescreen 1.85:1 The sound is in Dol Dig 2.0(MONO), but this isn't an action flick, so it's fine.There are caption in English(a nod to Universal there), subtitles in Spanish and French. There are no features of any kind other than scene selections.This film is a treasure from the 60's vault. Doris' outfits alone are smashing, and NYC in the 60's too. This film has no rating on the case, but I would say PG. There are some adult situations, but all done in tasteful fun(can you imagine Doris Day, doing anything else, even if she tried?).The other two films that this trio delight us with is ""Pillow Talk"" and ""Send Me No Flowers""Well, I'm off to watch another Day/Hudson/Randall film. I've got my bowl of VIP and ready for a fun evening.....Lauri"	1
"This is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning.  One does not need to love the results of these changes (I personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it, even as I marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election) to appreciate how Clinton's 1992 campaign, as seen in this film, changed the American political world. ""War Room"" should be seen along with more recent documentaries (like, for example, ""Staffers '04"") to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal (to be elected rather than to govern).  Hopefully, it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless, mind-numbing, dumbing down assessments of candidate traits (like ""character"" or ""integrity"") we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years"	1
"It embarrases me that I, a music man, have let this many years go by without reviewing this splendid movie. My wife rented it from a Hasting's video store back when DVDs were not widely distributed. I was in awe of the movie as it ended because I had no clue what to expect, and I wasn't expecting much anyway.Richard Dreyfuss plays the role of Glenn Holland, a recent college graduate who takes the job of a music teacher to provide an income (he calls it a 'fall back position') while he writes what he hopes will be a musical masterpiece that will make him rich and famous. His first semester is a trying and learning experience as students see him as that school teacher everybody hated and whose class everyone dreaded.But he finds his way into the students' hearts. The movie begins in the early 1960s, and rock 'n' roll has etched a permanent mark on the music landscape. Most of the students, of course, love the new music. Realizing he has an 'in' with the students, he makes an accurate comparison by playing Bach's ""Minuet in G"" (for Anna Magdalena) and asking the students what song it is. They reply it is the ""Lovers Concerto"" by the Toys (""What color is the rain that falls softly on my window..""). He notes they are wrong and that it is actually the SAME song (although he doesn't note that Bach's is in 3/4 and the Toys in 4/4) and is an example of an ancient music scale called the Dorian scale. He now has them right where he wants them.Along the way, he continues to work on his masterpiece. But life, a new baby who turns out to be deaf, and the need for new things put his life on hold. As he notes by quoting John Lennon, ""Life is what happens while you're making other plans"" (or some facsimile thereof). Years continue to go by and events occur that happen in the life of virtually ever music teacher.He has that one student who has a lot of heart but not a lot of ability - yet needs to get an hour of credit so he can remain eligible to play football. He has another student who wants to play the clarinet but is nervous. Yet he always comes back to the simple rock 'n' roll to make his point about 'real' music.But reality plays hide and seek sometimes. He has it out with his wife about their deaf son - and his frustrations come to a boiling point on the night John Lennon is killed. Over time, they become friends - and one of the sweet sights of the movie is the son feeling the vibrations from the speaker as he 'hears' the music.But another reality awaits - education budget cuts, and here Dreyfuss delivers the line with outstanding effect: ""The day they cut the football budget in this state...well, that will certainly be the end of western civilization as we know it."" It is in the presence of his now good friend, Jay Thomas (the football coach), that he talks about how he never wanted to teach but now that is all he wants to do.The music track in this movie is awesome. There's just one thing I'm still trying to figure out: how did the students manage to mass distribute his music and practice it without him knowing it?"	1
this dvd is one of the best i have seen. only britney spears live tops this in picture quality.ricki sings his best songs in front of new york city backdrop. he put alot of energy into this concert.the sound quality is the best and picture quality is also great. a little bit less fuzz on some objects would have been nice! but still its great and colorfull with all the lights on stage	1
"I understand that some fans would like to see more of their loved characters (this series is one of the best as far as I'm concerned), and I can understand the need in filling in a gap especually if the show hasn't been aired in a while on TV: but I cannot understand ANYONE who buys this DVD for ANY reason.You do not need this DVD to ""fill the gap in your collection."" They did the same thing with Chobits in episode 7, another damn recap. There's no point in watching it. The series is great, stick to the episodes both before and after this DVD. Trust me, I know how tempting it is to either rent this episode, get it on NetFlix, or go out and buy it outright... but don't. You'll only be sorry. There are a myriad of reasons why the company made this DVD (posted elsewhere) but what's important is that it is a waste of time and money.Great series (A+), This DVD = F."	0
"Alfred Hitchcock's second film after being brought to America by David O. Selznick was SUSPICION, which he made while on loan to RKO Pictures. As in his first Hollywood flick, REBECCA, he put Joan Fontaine to very good use and ultimately these two films made her into a star.Fontaine won the Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Lina McLaidlaw, a bookish and innocent (but wealthy) young woman who gets swept off her feet by the caddish Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant). After their quick courtship and marriage against her father's wishes, Lina begins to see Johnnie for who he really is--a penniless leech--but she naively continues to love him nonetheless. Johnnie's charm is ostensible, yet his irresponsible ways are increasingly becoming inexcusable. Lina's trust eventually gives way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to any length to pay off his mounting debts.Hitchcock masterfully builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the duration of the picture. The movie's only flaw is its tacked-on and seemingly contrived final scene which, we are told, was due either to Mr. Grant's popularity during these years or to the existence of the Production Code in effect in Hollywood at that time. Hitchcock wanted a darker ending but, as we see here, he lost that battle. However, he did not give in as completely as some would have us believe. The ending remains ambiguous enough to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion according to our own sensibilities.SUSPICION is classic Hitchcock. Grant and Fontaine turn in masterful performances and Nigel Bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable ""Beaky,"" Johnnie's old chum. The flawed ending prevents placing SUSPICION at the top of any list of Hitchcock's achievements, but it is a fine film nevertheless and I can only give it my highest recommendation.Jeremy W. Forstad"	1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I bought this for a little over $15 at another store and returned it within a week...Horrible transfer (if it were ALPHA video i wouldn't care, but come on...this is a major DVD company we're talking about, SONY!!!!!). Aspect ratio isnt the theatrical format, but rather PAN AND SCAN cropped sides bulls#it. Plus its missing like 20 minutes! I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. Just the thought of this release makes me angry (to the point of inarticulate). AVOID AVOID AVOID! and write a letter to your congressman (ha!)...or perhaps SONY/MGM. This release is inexcusable	0
"I just can't say enough good things about the Brainy Baby series of videos and toys.  I have allowed my baby to watch one Brainy Baby video per day since he was about 6 months old.  He loves them.  And I love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen.  :)  As soon as the Brainy Baby theme music comes on he starts to smile.  He is captivated.  I like them much more than the Baby Einstein videos.  And the toys.......he LOVES them.  ""Hello, Brainy Baby!""  They are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box.  I have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time.  We love Brainy Baby at our house. "	1
The ab portion of the DVD is good, although I fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether. The buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set. The last one is a step-type exercise so if you don't have something you can step up on, you can't do it. The DVD itself is not very professionally done. Tamilee miscounts, doesn't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words. Abs of steel maybe, buns of steel, no way	0
I checked this out because I wanted to take a look at what the new Doctor Who people have been doing in the recent past.  The Second Coming isn't quite as cosmic, but it certainly engages us in some comparable flights of fancy. Steve Baxter (Christopher Eccleston) has an epiphany one night when he's out on the town with some mates. He reckons he's become the Son of God and he proceeds to turn night into day at Maine Road football ground in order to demonstrate his divinely-chosen status (a bit like David Icke, except with powers). His immediate friends take their time to come to terms with this and despite becoming the `new disciples' some of them - notably Judith his girlfriend (Lesley Sharp) - remain sceptical. Through the media he tells the world that they must come up with a `Third Testament'. It later transpires that if they do not, the end of the world will soon follow.What are this messiah's credentials? Well, he spends forty days in the wilderness which is Saddleworth Moor and he has no earthly father - it turns out that his dad is infertile and couldn't have fathered him. This tickled me. Did writer Russell T. Davis pass his GCSE in Religious Studies, do we think? I couldn't really work out whether the religious symbolism was unconsciously corny and nave or whether it aimed at giving us a laugh. I'd like to think the latter. Steve, curiously, isn't what we might describe as spiritual - certainly not religious. He swears all the time, boozes and although not quite loutish, is somewhat laddish. He's a laddish messiah. His disciples swear at him and he insults them back. (Message to southerners - we in the north are not all like this, despite the plethora of dramas which suggest otherwise: Preston Front, Our Friends in the North, etc. Writers do seem to have this desire to patronise us thus.)What's noticeable about the founders of the major world religions is that they managed to espouse some degree of religious wisdom. Steve, who just witters nonsensically to the crowds, seems to lack this facility. Is he meant to be devoid of wisdom? Are we asking too much of Russell T. Davis to place some in his mouth? Could he have done so had he wished? Presumably our writer would need to possess some himself! (Jury's out.) It turns out that the party piece belongs to the sceptical girlfriend who clearly becomes the mouthpiece for the programme's message.So what happens? Despite almost two hours of waiting for Judgement Day, with little action or plot development we eventually come to learn that our messiah is something of a damp squib. He ends up at the girlfriend's home where she feeds him a dish of spaghetti a la rat poison which he takes willingly but not before we discover that he is really just a sort of encapsulation or epitome of human religiosity. Enlightened humanity - Judith - finally comes to realise that she can and must live without him and she spits him out. They argue for a while before atheism wins out and Steve chomps down the poisoned pasta (after the two hours I found myself saying `bon appetit'). So we get the sermon, although it's a secular one which declares the futility of religious belief. But this messiah seemed to me to be almost devoid of any meaningful religious ideas anyway. You can't debunk what doesn't exist. Steve can't be a foil for atheism if he IS a kind of atheism. I suppose that we do end up questioning Russell T Davis's understanding of spirituality, not to say he should necessarily adhere to religion or spirituality, but perhaps to understand it to come degree. And yes, there is a naivety and a corniness which underpins all this third-form philosophy, typical of so many young people working within the arts. It's a pity that the message of the piece couldn't have been delivered within the actual context of the drama itself. What we have is a two hour TV play followed by a secular sermon, subtext puked out and all. We do have an epilogue, however, where our new-found heroine is hilariously transfigured at the supermarket. I do recommend The Second Coming for amusement, but for enlightenment you'd better have something else to hand.	0
I'm sorry, but this is honestly one of the worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing.I purchased it after reading ambitious reviews that cited this movie was what mainstream horro should be. In reality, it's nearly everything that's WRONG with low-budget films. First off, the camera work is horrible. Secondly, I've seen more convincing actors in elementary school plays. I mean, these actors make Keanu Reeves look like Denzel Washington. And finally, the story was absolutely horribly done. I admit, the premise itself had some promise--But the way it was executed completely took away any interest factor I might have had.Plain and simply, this film was unwatchable. I turned it off 65% through it. And I would've turned it off earlier but I was hoping for some beacon of hope to appear on the screen.If you care at all about quality, in any sense, DO NOT GO NEAR THIS PIECE OF TRASH	0
We caught this movie on PBS when it first came on, and my daughter was hooked.  It's a change from the regular Arthur animation - this one is computer animated.  She was very intrigued by that fact, and then the story is about a puppy... well there you go!  The story is well written, a little scary at times when the guard dogs are chasing after Pal.  There are even a few catchy tunes as well.  Highly recommend this to every Arthur fan out there	1
This DVD is very cheesy and I am sorry I bought it.	0
Stoners, music, girls. 80's High school times in Cali. It takes you back to when vans were cool and the girls had way to much hairspray. Everytime I watch this movie Im ready to hit the beach. Good movie	1
Season four is excellent, can't wait for the release of season five	1
I was thrilled to find this set here on Amazon, and buying this set is so much cheaper then buying each volume seperatly. All of the DVD's have some good interviews with the producers, designers, voice actors, and other people associated with the show.  I don't usually like watching interviews/things where people talk a lot, but I love watching those interviews over and over and seeing the steps they took to make this show as good as it was. I totall reccomend it to anyone looking for something a little different	1
I agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very weak production with lots of pretentious talk and some pretty poor musical performances which are heavily cut to make more room for chatter. However the couple of minutes where Rory Block sings &quot;If I had Possession Over Judgement Day&quot; are worth the entire price of this DVD. Don't buy the tape 'cos you'll have to sit through so much stuff you won't make it, but on the DVD you can go straight to Rory Block and never watch the rest	0
Seeing what's become of the rock and roll legends I remember from when we were much younger, I found very depressing. I'd rather remember them the way they were 40 yrs ago. Even Jerry Lee looked like he was ready for the nursing home	0
The first two seasons of Chef! are absolutely brilliant and some of the most entertaining television one will ever watch. Season three, however, is virtually unwatchable - they changed director, changed from film to video tape, replaced many of the actors and the result is perhaps the fastest downfall of a great series in television history. I would avoid seasons three like the plague but do check out the first two seasons.	0
"What a great idea, to make a documentary of violinist Hilary Hahn traveling around the world and concertizing.  Undoubtedly at the top of her profession, Hahn never fails to amaze with her unmistakably gorgeous tone, enviable precision, and brilliant musicality.  This DVD ""portrait"" includes personal footage of Hahn backstage at the Philharmonie in Berlin, as well as a tour at the Curtis Institute, a recording session at Abbey Road Studios, and a trip to Hong Kong.  In an age of music commercialism, Hahn is refreshingly real and self-deprecating.  Included on this DVD are excerpts from the Korngold Concerto, Mozart Sonata for Piano and Violin in G major, The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, Chaconne from Partita in D minor by Bach, and the Paganini Concerto No. 1.  On the menu there is additional concerto footage, which includes the Korngold Concerto and Mozart sonata in their entirety - thank goodness, because there's nothing more aggravating than replaying excerpts.  If for nothing else, buy the DVD for these complete live recordings, because they are absolutely sublime.  The outer movements of the Korngold sound a lot like film music, which the classical music lover may or may not like, but the second movement is incredibly beautiful and highly recommended.  The Mozart sonata is also very well played, but this is nothing new as Hahn has already released a recording of this.  This DVD is important because it contains video footage of Hahn performing - the only other DVD where you can find her playing is The Last Night of the Proms, in which she plays the Mozart Concerto No. 4 in D Major and Presto from Sonata No. 1 by Bach, but the sound quality is somewhat lacking and certainly doesn't do justice to Hahn"	1
"I have always like Stephen Lynch.  His video ""Live at the ElRay"" was absolutely awesome.  I even gave one to my cousin this Christmas.  Defintely worth the price"	1
"With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love.  This film felt like a ""blind date"" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose.  Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the clich use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame.  Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale.  She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes.  I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors.  Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth.  Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally.  Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character.  His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant.  I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film?  There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' ""Looking at America"" class.  I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film.  Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn.  There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about.  I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film.  He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for.  I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way.  Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well.  Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature.  Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story.  I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met.  I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture.  I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just ""played it safe"".  The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin.  Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character?  I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters.  The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table.  I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further.  Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film.  The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old.  I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be!Grade: ** out of ****"	0
when I read the reviews, I thought that maybe I shouldn't see the movie, but I was desperate to rent it since DMX was in it. When I finished watching the movie, I thought that the people were full of crap. This movie was a great example of real life and it had a very good touching end	1
"If there's a worse movie than this I haven't seen it! Looks like it was made in a day. The quality is dark and muddy with choppy edits. Sort of like it was copied from a VHS tape that was recorded in the 6 hour mode after it was played 6,000 times. The actors and actresses deliver their lines like they are playing aliens in a bad Twilight Zone episode. If you look hard enough you can see the guy holding the cue cards in the scenes. The musical performances are obscure little known Doo Wop Flops! (except for Frankie Lymon). Look.....I wasted $14.99 plus tax plus gas to ""run out"" and buy this bomb. The only possible way to save it would be to maybe dub it in Swedish, send it to a Greenwich Village ""art house"" and pass it off as a foreign film. Come to think of it....don't bother to dub it.....the sound is so off it looks dubbed already! IMPORTANT UPDATE.....PLEASE READ THIS! I later discovered after I wrote this review that there is some significant social redeeming value to this little gem of the 50's. I understand that it is used constantly at the International Institute For Sleep Disorders as the most preferred method of inducing a semi-comcious near sleep state for incurable Insomniacs. And so as I write this update I've been watching the flick again and I must admit.....I.....(yawn) oh excuse me...where was I...oh yes I must admit that I.....(bigger yawn) Oh my goodness....I'm so sorry....This is so rude of me....(yawn) but it seems like.....(snoring)....I....(snoring) I just can't seem to (intense snoring)........"	0
"Robert Ryan made a number of Westerns during the 1950s and '60s, but always he seemed to be overshadowed by other actors in the genre. Nevertheless, who can forget THE WILD BUNCH or his magnificent portrayal of ""old man Clanton"" in the seriously underrated HOUR OF THE GUN (with James Garner). And his self-effacing determination is equally unforgettable in THE DAY OF THE OUTLAW. Now one of his best roles, as the straight-arrow sheriff in THE PROUD ONES is on DVD and available at a very reasonable price. Finally.  THE PROUD ONES is perhaps director Robert Webb's finest picture, combining great action scenes and plot twists, taught dialogue, and a superior cast that includes not only Ryan, but Jeffrey Hunter, Walter Brennan, Virginia Mayo, and Robert Middleton. Minor roles are given attention as well, especially Arthur O'Connell (as Ryan's deputy) and, important thematically, the wonderful Paul Burns, who plays the town drunk and panhandler....Hunter, when he finally assumes the mantle of sheriff, will give alms to Burns at the finish of the movie, just as Ryan did at the beginning, when he was sheriff. This touch dramatically completes the movie and has much to say about Hunter's increased maturity.  THE PROUD ONES is a superb movie, with a great story...it will repay re-viewing. Unlike some Westerns, I don't tire of watching it periodically. It is that good..."	1
It is a tragedy that Brandon Lee died while making this film.  Had he lived, the Crow sequels would have been much better.The Crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace.  It set the standard for the dark cinema of the 1990's.	1
"It takes an HBCU graduate to write about the HBCU experience, period. Just look at ""A Different World"" and how bad the first season was. Debbie Allen (a Howard grad, I believe) stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed. So it's no surprise that Spike Lee, the Morehouse man, would make a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin. I'm not saying that you had to attend an HBCU to UNDERSTAND ""School Daze"", but you had to have attended one to get the real ""flavor"" of what it was like. And you have to have an open mind.Any HBCU alum saying that this film wasn't realistic is flat-out lying. Yes, it hit on some things that the old folks call ""dirty laundry"" (such as hazing, color issues, those who think that getting an education makes you ""white"", and so on), but those things are real at HBCUs - yes, even today. (Major props to Spike for having that ONE dark-skinned sista in the Gamma Rays. Isn't that ALWAYS the way?) And there are no ""good"" people or bad people; Spike leaves that decision up to you. Julian had his good points (his intelligence, leadership and pride in his town, school, etc) and Dap had his bad points (his blatant bigotry and bullying), and both of them had legitimate points. One thing Spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students tended to have on a regular basis. No offense to whites or anyone who graduated from a PWC, but in my experience at a predominately white high school, I noticed that students there were a lot more subtle with their dislike; they particpated in a more ""destroying from within"" kind of system, and grew wide-eyed and offended when confronted, even with solid proof. (""I would NEVER spread rumors about you/sleep with your boyfriend/steal your term paper!"") Black students, on the other hand, will take ANYONE head-on, whether that person is the school president, captain of the football team, the richest kid on campus, crippled...doesn't matter. Your ""status"" doesn't count if you go to an HBCU. I had a friend who saw SD and said ""That is SO unrealistic! Since when do college kids go fighting with each other all the time?"" She graduated from the University of Texas. Enough said.I'm so grateful for this film, and its realistic portrayal of black HBCU students for those who think that all young black people do is have babies and suck up welfare, and that people only go to HBCUs because they can't get into a ""real"" college. I wouldn't trade my experience at Florida A&M University for a degree at any PWC. RATTLERS"	1
"I'm not usually a ballet person.  I haven't seen anything since ""The Nutcracker"" when I was six.  But this was absolutely brilliant.  The concept for it is completely bold and original and Adam Cooper as The Swan blew me away.  How can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop?  Tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this, but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet. "	1
When I received this DVD, I played it on my iMac. When doing this, I discovered that there were Chinese characters showing at the top of the screen. The quality of the DVD images were dark and grainy. I reported to Amazon that they had unknowlngly sold me a pirated DVD, and I was saddened to not have a response from Amazon other than refunding my costs. Copyright is not only a law to protect publishers; it also protects consumers from getting poor quality products. I feel that I can no longer depend on Amazon to provide my DVD orders.	0
I rented this (sigh) several years ago, liked it or Julia Roberts enough to buy it but didn't open the new copy until the other day and watched it today.  I regretted buying a new copy after all, remembering it only as a few heartwarming (I didn't want my heart warmed) months in the lives of just plain folks in CT.  (Incidentally, the 3 girls are not sisters, just 2 of them.)  I made fun of it, my friend made fun of it, I watched a few minutes then turned it off, then watched some more, finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish it.  It has charm.  It IS a soap opera, but I thought it was well acted and well done.  It had humor, happiness, sadness, embarrassment (like the barrels of fish in the rich kid's car), love.  It had so much plot that it practically had none at all.  And I liked it.  But now, 15 minutes later, I'm beginning all over again to wonder why I bought it.  I could have done without hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the flick.  That man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at all, no range, no depth, somehow he could carry a tune, but that's about the size of it, speaking of size, the size of his ego (which I assume is why he didn't deign to sing the tunes the way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics) would have made a mushroom cloud!  I recommend this movie if you like this kind of thing.  For it's kind, I thought it was perfectly done.  I just like them a smidge more sophisticated.  The vulgarity and blasphemies were delicious.	1
I've had the opportunity to watch the movie Stealth over the past week.It was on TV here. Otherwise, I don't think I would have watched it.My instincts would have been correct.An action technothriller, Stealth has a predictable plot. A new elite team of 3 good-looking pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field: an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots, including a disrespect for authority. Mayhem ensues. People die. The leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence, and they work together to save the female pilot, who's gone down in North Korea.The plot, direction, and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads (Josh Lucas, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx) that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart.I'm sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads, and came away disappointed. Me? I was expecting little, so I guess my expectations were met.Though I will say I was amused by the last line	0
"I would argue that since we really haven't evolved all that far since our primate days human males still have loads of aggression and animalistic behavior they need to get out. And despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace. In Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"" it comes out in all the wrong places. The film is a character study of one Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a Wall Street yuppie by day and an ax murderer by night. Patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge because of the fakeness that surrounds him. It's not just the suits and the empty conversations either. It is the peeing contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business card. He tries to talk about his problems, he really does, but nobody listens to him because nobody listens period. To their ears ""Murders and Executions"" is interchangeable with ""Mergers and Acquisitions."" The film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980's. This particular Gordon Gekko is overdone and overacted by Christian Bale in a great performance. He is robotic, phony, arrogant and absurd. He is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so (all the while flexing his biceps). More than anything he is militantly materialistic. He is Dexter mixed with Jim Profit, only he likes to style and profile while taking an ax to a co-workers head. The whole point, which is made clear in the final scene, is that while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer matters it is really the inside that counts. Just because these people make enough cash to swim in, Scrooge McDuck style, doesn't mean that their behavior is excusable. Harron paints the modern businessman as an American Psycho, and it is all too fitting. To make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must be turned off, you must be turned into Patrick Bateman.The film is a great success. As a horror movie villain Patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever. Every scene has great energy to it and even though Bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you can't stop watching him. There is something of a conflict presented when Willem Dafoe shows up to play a detective on the case of one of Patrick's murders. That storyline is interesting while it lasts, but it is never quite wrapped up. I would also admit that after awhile I got a little sick of swimming in these debaucherous waters. He may never tire of having it dirty and bloody but I eventually did. The character is endlessly fascinating (what is up with his love of cheesy 80's music?) and the scene where he kills Paul Allen will leave you stunned and hypnotized. The male need for aggression isn't going anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it. . .otherwise we are going to have a lot more Patrick Bateman's and Iraq Wars on our hands. ***3/"	1
